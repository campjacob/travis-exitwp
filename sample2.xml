<p>I am nobody special and the things that I have gone through (in feeling) are not uncommon.  Most everybody has felt the pain of abandonment, the hurts that only somebody close can give, or the loss of somebody close.  This generation coming up, is a fatherless one.  This is partly the cause of so many angry kids and too many young people who live seemingly purposeless lives.  I will tell you the truth though God is big enough to fill the void for all those kids, and the voids in all of our lives.  My name is Jacob Campbell, and I was born October 18, 1982.  Some of my earliest years were spent in a courtroom with my father.  He was on trial for three accounts of murder.  This was going on in Snohomish County, and his name was like a household item, for those living in the area.  Charles Rodman Campbell was and sentenced to death row.  During the same era that &quot;Death Row Records&quot; with Tu Pac, Dr. Dre, and others was created, I was visiting my dad on Death Row at Walla Walla State Penn.  Even though he was in prison we had a good relationship, sometimes, because my mom and I would visit him weekly.  My dad would also write me letters all the time, I wouldn't write him back very often though (I was young).  In 1994, when I was in the 6th grade there was a decision that my fathers time was up.  I went and petitioned the Governor, I didn't want my dad to die.  He was executed, only the second man to be executed in the state of Washington recently.</p>

<p>This caused a lot of hurt in my life, and I started wanting to run away from it all.  In middle school I did not really have any friends.  When I got into High School I got involved heavily in the party scene.  I look back now it seems like I was trying to dull my senses.  I abused almost any drug that you might name, and had my life completely caught up in the whole scene.  The really scary thing was my drinking, I would also go and nightly drink until I was stupid drunk past the point of control and feeling.  I should have died a number of times driving recklessly drunk.  I was in jail, when some people came and told me about this program called Jubilee.  I listened to them, but it didn't seem like the kind of thing that I wanted to do.  I was satisfied with the way my life was.  It wasn't until weeks after I was out of Benton County Corrections, and Jose Hernandez (then the Director at Jubilee) called my at my school, the local alternative high school, and told me about the scholarship that I would receive if I graduated from Jubilee.  I took a huge leap and put myself into the program.  I had decided to go for completely opposite reasons, then those that I would later leave the program with.  I was only going to receive the scholarship, not thinking about changing my life.  Luckily, God had a different plan.  Talking with some of the Residential Councilors and being surrounded by the Word started to tug on my heart.  One day I herd God speaking to me about being my comforter.  I asked Him to come into my heart, and my life, and I haven't been the same since.  The Tri-City Harold wrote an <a href= "http://www.tri-cityherald.com/tch/local/story/8701344p-8602437c.html">article</a> (it is no longer a valid link, I will post a graphic / text of it at a later time) about me, and somebody even wrote an <a href= "http://www.tri-cityherald.com/tch/opinions/letters/story/8733004p-8634702c.html">opinion</a> (it is no longer a valid link, I will post a graphic / text of it at a later time)peice about my life.</p>  <p>I've come a long way's in my life, and have overcome some obstacles, but I am still growing.  That is the desire of my heart that I can identify with Jesus in my life.  I'm learning more about who God has created me to be, and finding out how to follow him.  I went and lived in Spokane for two years, doing this discipleship program call the Master's Commission.  During this time I was able to deal with a lot of the issues in my life.  I have found God to be my forgiver, breaking off the shame that has tried to pull me down so many times.  I've also heard Him call me His son.  It's the greatest revelation that we are children of God.  That he calls us by His name, and we are created in His image.  I have so much further to go, but the foundation has been set, and I've tasted and know that God is Good.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Cultural Competence: Awareness</title>
      <link>/resources/cultural-competency-awareness</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>*based on notes taken during my MSW on 07/29/2008</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The culturally competent practitioner is one who has moved from being culturally unaware to being aware and sensitive to his or her own cultural heritage and to valuing and respecting difference</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Quite likely, the simplest definition of culture is any shared beliefs and values. This definition lets culture be identified from the micro family level to the larger macro national level.</p>

<h2 id="culturallycompetentpractitionersawarenessknowledge">Culturally Competent Practitioners: Awareness &amp; Knowledge</h2>

<p>Self-awareness is an important factor for any clinician to evaluation in regards to having a culturally competent practice. I would say that this is the foundation of any real and positive cultural awareness. The practitioner must know about their own values, biases, and any areas that they might have transference with their clients. They must also strive to be comfortable with the differences that exist between themselves and their clients. This can be in regards to race, gender, sexual orientation, and other socio-demographic variables. This means a continuous reassurance that differences do not necessarily mean deviance, but that they are just different. A clear and explicit knowledge and understanding of the generic characteristics of counseling and therapy is required to be able to apply those techniques in a culturally informed manner.</p>

<p>Practitioners have a call to be culturally informed and to be flexible (this means being sensitive to our client’s circumstances). Being culturally informed means possessing specific knowledge and information about the particular group with which he or she is working. Regardless of the client’s culture, the clinician also must have an understanding of the sociopolitical system’s operation in the United States with respect to its treatment of marginalized groups in our society. Part of understanding our sociopolitical system is having an awareness of institutional barriers that prevent some diverse client populations from using mental health service. Often times, we gain much of this insight from participating in minority mental health consultations.</p>

<h2 id="culturalcompetenceskills">Cultural Competence Skills</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Silence is OK … <br />
  … our pauses <br />
  can be pregnant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The following are some skills that can help a clinician in being more culturally competent:</p>

<ul>
<li>Generate a wide variety of both verbal and nonverbal responses</li>
<li>Send and receive both verbal and nonverbal messages accurately and appropriately</li>
<li>Exercise institutional intervention skills on behalf of your client when appropriate</li>
<li>Be aware of his or her helping style, recognizes the limitations that he or she possesses, and anticipate the impact on the culturally different client</li>
<li>Assume a number of different helping roles</li>
</ul>

<p>Single system design, sometimes referred to as Single subject design is a longitudinal study of one person, family, or group. It is a study of repeated measures with data collected over time. It is often utilized as for analyzing change between measurements. They have the following components:</p>

<ul>
<li>One participant</li>
<li>The baseline is the measurement at pretest</li>
<li>Intervention with measurement repeated</li>
<li>Introduce treatment + measure / assess for improvement change in behavior</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, if someone was to study the smoking habits of one person. In the graph below, the baseline is the amount of cigarette that the participate smoked a day before the intervention is implemented. After a period of time an intervention is implemented (i.e. utilizing the patch, nicorette gum... etc). Part B is known as the treatment phase. It shows the amount of cigarette smoked by the participate after the intervention.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="theeconomyandsocialworkhowtheeconomicdownturneffectssocialserviceagencies">The Economy and Social Work: How the Economic Downturn Effects Social Service Agencies</h2>

<p>You can read a downloadable version of this article:  <a href="/s/economy-social-work-how-economic-downturn-effects-social-service-agencies.pdf">The Economy and Social Work: How the Economic Downturn Effects Social Service Agencies</a></p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>With the worldwide, national, state, and local economies facing an economic downturn, it is important to examine its effects on social service agencies and social work. The active policy of how economic downturns effect social service agencies is examined though a number of modalities. When looking at these types of policies the affected populations must be described. The historical, worldwide, national, and statewide perspectives provide context and understanding of the problem. A policy analysis matrix is also utilized to give a more concrete description of the crisis.</p>

<p>People's views on money vary. One thing that does not vary around the world and throughout history is peoples need for some form of money to survive and pay for or trade for goods or services. With an economic downturn happening both around the world and around the nation, it would appear the topic of money is on the forefront of people's minds. This is displayed though what people are searching for on the internet. Exploring the news reference volume on Google (2009), using the words "economy" or "stimulus" shows the percentage of traffic significantly increasing starting at the beginning 2008.</p>

<p>In a study examining sleep and the economic downturn, Hendrick, B. (2009) found people are losing sleep over the economy. Forty-one percent describe losing sleep a few nights a week in the past month due to personal financial concerns, worries over the employment, or concerns over the economy. The National Council for Community and Behavioral Healthcare (2009) describes a 66 percent rise in peoples described stress being related to the economy since April. Harris (2009) describes the possibility of loss of social service agencies during the economic downturn. All in all the economic downturn may prove to be a major problem both in America and around the world. While there is a crisis around the world and in America it is not the first time.</p>

<h2 id="ahistoricalperspective">A Historical Perspective</h2>

<p>Throughout the modern history of economics, economic downturns and recessions have occurred. The first took place between 1797 and 1800. This first recession caused a huge disruption in the real estate and commercial markets. Since the panic of 1787 there have been twenty-three different periods of recession in the United states. These have included closures of banks, stock market crashes, high unemployment rates, difficulties with the real estate and commercial markets. They have also had impacts both nationally and international, and include a host of other problems (Cush, n.d.).</p>

<p>Probably the best known time of economic downturn is the Great Depression. Capital gains going up, rising unemployment characterized the Great Depression (Keating, 2008). The Great Depression was precluded with an era of prosperity, the rolling twenties. This gave way to economic depression, bank panic and closures, and the crash of the stock market (Timeerlake, 1974; Gay, 1932).</p>

<h2 id="variouseffectsofeconomicdownturnsonsocialserviceagenciesthroughhistory">Various Effects of Economic Downturns on Social Service Agencies Through History</h2>

<p>Economic downturns have also affected social service agencies. McCormick (2002) describes a decrease in charitable contributions after the early 21st century dot com bust. He describes both individual and governmental giving decreasing, while the needs of non-profit services increasing. These needs regarding more people that are vulnerable requiring the services these organizations provide. This required many agencies in the Chicago area being required to trim their budget and request more donations or gifts. Although these hard times for non-profit agencies often mean difficulty, it is not always that case. McCormick describes the Chicago-based America's Second Harvest (a distributor of food pantries nationwide) both had a increase in demand for services and contributions of foods and finances. America's Second Harvest actually exceeded their budget by more than 10 percent during the same time that these other agencies were struggling.</p>

<p>With various charities facing losses in income, there are many examples of them being forced to band together to help offset costs. Fields-White (2008) examines how nine of Chicago's largest charities banding together to help offset costs. These organizations believe they can save up to $20 million annually though creating an entity, which handles all the various administrative functions. Many states during recessions cut funding to social service programs in attempts to balance their budget. A Report: States Cutting Human-service Programs (2002) described at the time nineteen states were looking at specific cuts to low income and human service programs.</p>

<p>Along with various social service agencies banding together to attempt to offset costs, some are forced to let some of their employees go. Poltenson (2006) examines the changes regarding public sector jobs verses the number of non-profit sector jobs. Poltenson shows after the 2000 recession in New York, the number of people employed in the non-profit sector payrolls as "decapitated." The non-profit sector lost six percent of their employment. The public sector appeared to replace those jobs, rising 6.7 percent in the same period. Statewide the public sector saw an increase of 8.7. The inverse of this trend of economic difficulty and private sector jobs going down and public sector jobs going up is also true. Fredrickson (2003) looks at the non-profit sector after the 2001-2003 recession. In New York, the non-profit sector grew 1.9 percent. The recession also accelerated a trend of workers being willing to take lower-paying jobs in non-profit services.</p>

<h2 id="aglobalperspective">A Global Perspective</h2>

<p>Macleod (2009) when looking at the global economy explains if the global economy does indeed decline during the 2009 year, it would be the first time since the 1930's. He cites the United Nations as forecasting this event to occur. Worldwide nations are feeling the pinch, and many are even putting together their own stimulus packages (Thredgold 2008; Scherer 2009). The Democratic Leadership Council and Progressive Policy Institute (2009) describe fifteen nations who are currently implementing stimulus packages. These packages total at almost two trillion dollars USD. The nations looking at putting together and the amounts of the stimulus packages around the world are consistently changing due to the current nature of this paper.</p>

<p>During the Great Depression, few nations internationally were buffered from the economic crisis. The world's economic pictures were worsened from bleak to bleaker (Adas 1992). Raum and Wagner (2009) describe that while we are not necessarily in a depression currently, nobody disputes the current downturn of the economy is a recession. They explain last year's the stock market was the worst since 1931. Regardless of the extent of how low the stock market currently is, to approach the levels of the Great Depression, the Dow Jones industrials would have to fall 5,000 more points.</p>

<h2 id="anationalperspective">A National Perspective</h2>

<p>While there are many problems all around the world, there are also problems in America. Mid February President Obama signed the $787 billion national stimulus plan into effect. This package focuses on a number of different areas and approaches. The stimulus package offers a couple of approaches. The first is in spending; $111 billion towards infrastructure and science, $81 billion in protecting the vulnerable populations, $59 billion towards health care, $53 billion in education and training, $43 billion towards energy, and eight billion dollars towards other funds. The second is though $288 billion in tax relief, and $144 billion in state and local fiscal relief (Yourish &amp; Stanton 2009; Neighborhood Link 2009).</p>

<p>The economic stimulus plan is not the only concern for Americans. There is the global and national economic crisis. A part of the economic downturn also includes other factors. With nonfarm payroll employment continuing to fall sharply (-651,000) in February and the unemployment rate rising from 7.6 to 8.1 percent. Job losses are large and widespread across nearly all major industry sectors (Bureau of Labor Statistics 2009). Employment is also a major concern for many Americans. The bailout of the banks using the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and the loss of many financial institution is another topic that is on the mind of many Americans (Somerville 2008). Americans also have to worry about the housing and mortgage crisis (Armour 2009; Bohan &amp; Zengerle 2009; Arnold 2009).</p>

<p>Along with all of these concerns nationally, many of the states are facing their own problem. Forty-seven states in America are facing shortfalls on their budget. Combined this shortfall is $51 billion. Forty-three states are already projecting budget shortfalls for their 2010 budgets. The state's budget downfalls are already larger than the closest previous recession. These budget shortfalls make up an average of ten percent of the forty-seven states general budgets. This percentage of states general budget ranges from Arizona with almost 16 percent and Michigan with a little under one percent (McNichol &amp; Lav 2009).</p>

<h2 id="washingtonstateexamined">Washington State Examined</h2>

<p>One of the states that is facing economic woes is Washington State. Washington State is currently facing a six billion dollar budget shortfall (Office of the Governor, n.d. a).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"A budget crisis tests our basic values. We can't let tough times become an excuse for sacrificing what matters most to our families—access to high-quality health care and a world-class education for our children. The steps we take today determine our future and that of Washington's families."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With this economic downturn in Washington State, it is very likely to see many of the same sorts of results as of previous recessions from other parts of the nation.</p>

<p>Washington State is looking at loosing 12 percent of their social and health service agency funding. Just looking at the access to health care, it is estimated that 40 thousand people might lose their health care (Seattle-PI Editorial Board, 2008). The Governor signed a hiring freeze to reduce the number of people on the state payroll. This freeze lasted for five months and reduced the number of state employees by almost 1.5 thousand or about two percent. Along with this, in the Governors budget proposal is looking at cutting another almost 2.5 thousand positions (The Associated Press, 2009).</p>

<p>The budget cuts in Washington State appear as if they are going to affect funding for detoxification beds, inpatient beds and outpatient treatment services. The Governors budget calls for a 50 percent cut in funding to these agencies. The intended consequence of this appears to be to help close the budget gap. Bermant (2009) describes some unintended impacts of this policy. He quotes the Central Kitsap Commissioner as describing the population who would generally be in chemical dependency agencies ending up in hospital emergency rooms and county jails. The Drug Court is another program that that will be effected by the budget cut. They are expecting to not accept new admissions due to the financial changes, even though they have been credited with saving money and decreasing stress on other agencies the funding will not be available to continue expanding these benefits. These economical costs can be argued. Farley (2009) describes the differences in cost. It costs $80 per day to house an inmate in county jail. It costs $90 to have a patient in a recovery center. This leaves out the possible prevention / future crime costs. The price of victimization is another hidden cost. Farley describes transformation as a difficult item to put a price on.</p>

<p>With the budget deficit in Washington State, agencies are attempting to save money any way that they can. One possible budget saving topic brought up to the state legislature was breaking up the Department of Social and Health Services. The latest proposal put into the house legislature was to break up the agency within two years into four separate agencies: the Department of Economic Services, Department of Medical Assistance, Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services and the Department of Children's Services. The Governor chose to take this possibility off the discussion table while the major budget shortfall is still in effect. The merits of such an idea were a hotly debated topic (Seattle Times Editorial, 2009; Wilson, 2009).</p>

<p>While some agencies might be exploring breaking up as a method for economic support, others are exploring consolidation. One example of this is the Council for Children and Families and the Family Policy Council. They feel these agencies would be able to synergistically improve results and possibly attract additional federal and private dollars if combinded. These two organizations would merge into a new organization, the Family Investment Partnership. They anticipate a reduction in the number of boards, councils, and commissions along with the number of meetings. They also expect more efficiency in technical assistance, administration, and policy guidance. All of this would be expected to enhance the capacity to produce positive outcomes for children, families, and communities. Due to the timing of this paper, it is not possible to discuss whether this action has taken place (J. Schenk, personal communication, March 04, 2009)</p>

<h2 id="policyanalysis">Policy Analysis</h2>

<p>There are a number of different methods for directly analyzing various policies. Policies often are thought of very specifically. For example, when somebody discusses a specific policy they might look at a specific bill in the legislature or a specific policy and procedure of an agency. Policy can also be more general, as the various policies have been described in this paper (Policy, n.d.). The very least any analysis looks at the three P's of policy analysis: problem, policy, provision. This method encompasses the major components of a standard policy analysis (R. Harrington, personal communication, January 8).</p>

<p>Often policy analysis requires more direction then the three P's of policy analysis. A more in-depth view of policy analysis includes two major categories. The first is actual components of the analysis. These components of analysis include the following; problem, goals, policy and or legislation, implementation, affected population, and impact (both intended and unintended). The second deals with the various paradigms that are involved with each of those components. The paradigms of policy analysis include; values, history, economics and fiscal understanding, organizational and structural relationships, and consequences (again both intended and unintended). Examining each of the components and the underlying paradigms allows one to gain an in-depth understanding of a specific policy or general policies. Thus far, this paper has gone from the very broad concepts of the policy of economic downturns effect on social service agencies (R. Harrington, personal communication, January 8).</p>

<p>This two pronged approach to policy analysis can be transformed into a working matrix to understand a specific policy. For example, the components of the policy analysis would be in the rows. The paradigms of policy analysis would make up the columns. Where each of the sections intersect, a component of the policy would be described or the underlying paradigm. Some of the components and paradigms are redundant, such as the implications and consequences. Furthermore, some of the paradigms could also be placed as components, such as history or economic. Regardless of these small discrepancies, applying this matrix to various policies gives a rounded view of the policy in question. </p>

<h2 id="nomatterhowloudishoutbookdescription">No Matter How Loud I Shout: Book Description</h2>

<p>Humes (1999) was granted unprecedented access to the juvenile courts in California. The juvenile court system is closed to outsiders and often seems secretive. The juvenile court system encompasses a large number of youth. In California there are 30,000 juvenile delinquency cases brought to court each year, 26 juvenile detention camps with some 4,400 youth, and 8,700 juvenile prison wards. The courts only have four basic sentences they can give to juveniles; (1) HOP (home of parent); (2) suitable placement (a network of public and private foster homes); (3) juvenile detention camps; (4) juvenile prison. This gives only limited options to how a judge can sentence a delinquent youth.</p>

<p>Humes book describes the various aspects of the Californian juvenile justice system. It moves around the stories of seven different teenagers involved in the court system. He also has in-depth look some different judges, their views and court rooms. Along with the judges he provides stories that involve attorneys, probation officers, youth, delinquents, families, social workers, teachers, and many others that come and go though the lives of the teenagers. It is all set up in story lines that intertwine together to give the reader a picture of court system.</p>

<h2 id="workingwithjuvenileoffenders">Working with Juvenile Offenders</h2>

<p>Working with a diverse population requires the social worker examine aspects that make up the population. To fully examine a population, a few of the aspects that should be researched are as follows; best practices for working with the population, cultural background, tradition, norms and values, history of oppression, types of support, family dynamics, spirituality, and body language. The stories that fill Humes book come and address each of these aspects at different points.</p>

<p>Working with a diverse population requires the social worker examine aspects that make up the population. To fully examine a population, a few of the aspects that should be researched are as follows; best practices for working with the population, cultural background, tradition, norms and values, history of oppression, types of support, family dynamics, spirituality, and body language. The stories that fill Humes book come and address each of these aspects at different points.</p>

<p>The culture that these juveniles participate, the street / gang culture, is one that has a lot of facets to it. Each of the delinquents live their life based on this culture. The street / gang culture is portrayed to have very strict unwritten rules and is enforced by other juveniles. For example, the juveniles couldn't let others disrespect them in any way and let them get away with it. One of the juveniles mothers questions how her son could believe that "the lesser of two evils was to participate in a murder rather then risk being jeered by his friends" (p. 212).</p>

<p>This street / gang culture has specific traditions, norms and values. The process for a juvenile to become involved in a gang often has a tradition the youth must participate. Often this is some sort of jumping in and some sort of crime. For example, one of the youths had to commit a robbery with some of the older members. If a juvenile is a narc (slang for narcotics officer, but often used to describe somebody who tells the authorities about some illegal action) there are often stringent penalties enforced by their peers. They have a strict not talking to the authorities lifestyle. Humes describes that in some of the juvenile prisons the youth were victims of beatings, gang fights, stabbings, assaults, and even rapes, but because of this norm they were not reported. The street / gang culture values respect above everything else. This is why the aforementioned youth would rather be involved in a murder then be disrespected.</p>

<p>In re Gault (1967) was a changing point possible recourses for juvenile judges. Gerald Francis Gault, who was fifteen years old, was arrested for allegedly making an obscene phone call. Gault was on probation and the police did not leave notice with Gault's parents, who were at work, when the youth was arrested. Gault was committed to the State Industrial School until he reached the age of 21 for the offence. The Supreme Court decided that the courts were not complying with the 14th amendment. This action limited the courts but also shows an example of how juvenile delinquents have been oppressed in the past.</p>

<p>The juveniles are shown to have an expansive support system. The quality of the support offered seemed to almost always fail them though. Many of the juveniles portrayed in the book come from families that are less then supportive. Once the juvenile is in the system there are a number of supports that are meant to help them. These are described as having too high of caseloads and responsibilities to be effective at anything.</p>

<p>One support that is not external, but that is internal is spirituality. Although spirituality is not important to all of the incarcerated juveniles, Humes describes many that come to religious convictions while incarcerated. Spirituality is also important for some of the portrayed workers, for example Sister Janet Harris who works at the juvenile detention out of her religious convictions.</p>

<p>The incarcerated adolescents have a few body language characteristics that seem to be fairly common. Many of the youth are portrayed as being stone faced while they are in court, or dealing with authority figures, giving a "I don't give a f<em>*</em>" facial expression. They are also often described with aggressive body language. There are also times that the opposite is true and they are shown very broken and hurting.</p>

<h3 id="puttingitintopractice">Putting it into Practice</h3>

<p>Any study in social work should contain some sort of application, and looking at Humes' book should be no different. In looking at all of the various criteria for working with diverse populations, it seems to dictate some different ways of working with juveniles. First, it seems that one of the largest needs is to work with juveniles is their environment. Continually Humes goes back to the concept that these gang bangers all come from and go back to the same sort of environment. Second, it seems that the worker needs to find ways to gain the adolescents respect. Finally is also a need for firmness and structure because this is what they often grew up without.</p>

<p>Further then looking into what needs to be done, an analysis must also look into the validity of the information. Humes book is, although from many different aspects, very subjective and case studies of individuals. Within these individual stories, there is a large amount of statistical backing showing it to be true for major parts of the population. The book is lacking in descent of opinion for what are the best practices for working with juveniles, so the reader questions if Judge Dorn's ideas are the most effective and no true evidence is given to support them. It seems to give a good picture of what the juvenile justice system looks like, a broken system in need of substantial change.</p>

The juvenile court system encompasses a large number of youth. In California there are 30,000 juvenile delinquency cases brought to court each year, 26 juvenile detention camps with some 4,400 youth, and 8,700 juvenile prison wards. The courts only have four basic sentences they can give to juveniles; (1) HOP (home of parent); (2) suitable placement (a network of public and private foster homes); (3) juvenile detention camps; (4) juvenile prison. This gives only limited options to how a judge can sentence a delinquent youth.</p>]]></excerpt:encoded>

<p>You can read the downloadable version of the the article:  <a href="/s/crc-executive-summary.pdf">The Crisis Residential Center's Directions Program Evaluation: For the 2006-2008 Financial Grant Years</a></p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>Nationally over 1.5 million youth runaway and put themselves in dangerous situations such as substance abuse. Research shows that this is in a large part due to problems within the family unit. Many interventions assist in reunifying the family and improving dangerous or maladaptive behaviors including family and group therapies. Spokane's Crisis Residential Center attempts to assist this population by encouraging family reunification. One way in which they do this is through the Directions Program. This study evaluates the Directions Program to determine its effectiveness in serving at-risk youth and their families. Surveys were sent out to 128 former clients and their families.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The U.S. Department of Justice's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention found there were about 1,682,900 youth who ran away or were forced out of their homes (Hammer, Finkelhor &amp; Sedlak, 2002; National Coalition for the Homeless, 2008). Over 1.5 million of these youth have been in danger while they were away from home due to physical or substance abuse.</p>

<p>Youth runaway for several reasons. Many come from homes where they are not feeling supported or nurtured. According to a study, which looked at more than 600 homeless or runaway adolescents, their families were often abusive or neglectful toward the youth. In addition, there could be parental substance abuse and issues with the law (Whitbeck &amp; Hoyt, 1999).</p>

<p>Homeless adolescents face developing mental health issues such as depression and conduct disorder (Robertson, 1989, as cited in Coalition on Homelessness and Housing, 2002). Additionally, these youth face barriers that keep them homeless. A study by Miller et. al. (2004), which interviewed 19 youth, found most dropped out of school before they were able to graduate. Thus, street youth typically lack education. This may limit their ability to get a job or at least earn enough money to support themselves.</p>

<p>Programs that work with at-risk youth have a number of practices they implement. Group therapy is one such practice. Zimet and Farley (1985) state groups provide the client with interpersonal experiences to help foster social skills (as cited in Silvan, Matzner, &amp; Silva, 1999, p. 469). In residential treatment programs, groups are led by trained facilitators who teach youth and their families skills to cultivate independence, communication, and family reunification. They also provide opportunities for clients to help each other in learning the skills (Miley, O'Melia, &amp; DuBois, 2004).</p>

<p>Apart from group therapy, perhaps the most important factor in intervening with this population is efforts to encourage family reunification. Family issues have been identified as being a main precipitating problem that leads to youth running away (Safyer, Thompson, Macio, Zittel-Palamara, &amp; Forehand, 2004). Thus, it is interesting to note studies have found that family therapy and successful family reunification has led to improvements on various aspects such as school, runaway behaviors, and family stability (Thompson, Kost, &amp; Pollio, 2003; Thompson, Pollio, &amp; Bitner, 2000; Teare, Furst, Peterson, &amp; Authier, 1992). In addition to these behaviors, family therapy, which may lead to family reunification, has been shown to have a positive impact on drug use. These interventions improved such behaviors (Schmidt, Liddle, and Dakof, 1996; Huey, Henggeler, Brondino, &amp; Pickrel, 2000). Thus, it is agreed among many researchers family therapy is key to achieving positive outcomes.</p>

<p>The successes made in treatment, individually and as a family, must be maintained. Many agencies offer referrals and/or aftercare services to clients where they may receive continued treatment. Nebbitt, et al. (2007) found participation in referrals after discharge facilitated the successful reunification of the family. This highlights the need for continued intervention.</p>

<p>These services, along with individual counseling, provide at-risk youth the help they need to get off the streets and to change their course. Many residential programs offer these interventions to at-risk youth and their families with that goal in mind. Youth Family Adult (YFA) Connections is one such agency. YFA Connections is a nonprofit agency that serves the greater Spokane area with counseling and substance abuse treatment programs. One program offered through YFA Connections is Spokane's Regional Crisis Residential Center (CRC). The CRC assists youth are 13-17 and who come from a of variety situations (YFA Connections, n.d.; Christensen, 2008). The CRC runs three different programs: Directions, State CRC, and Hope. This study focuses on the Directions Program.</p>

<p>The Federal Basic Center Grant funds the Directions Program. The grant's stated purpose is strengthening community-based programs addressing the immediate needs of runaway and homeless youth and their families. Centers funded by the grant provide youth with emergency shelter, basic needs, counseling, and referrals. The Directions program has specific service requirements to be able to receive the Basic Center Grant. These include providing temporary shelter, employing individual, group and family counseling, offering recreational activities, and linking clients to services in the community (Basic center grant program 2006).</p>

<p>This research begins to explore how effective the CRC is in meeting the needs of its clients. It intended to add to the existing research by including the perceptions of the clients themselves. Despite the limitations to meeting this goal, this study still adds to the existing research regarding working with at-risk youth and it attempted to provide a multifaceted view of the CRC through the various methods implemented in the research. It examined the critical issues that many at-risk youth face and the services that were provided to them. This helps the CRC know what can be improved to be better able to reach the diverse needs of their clients in the upcoming 2009 year and beyond.</p>

<h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2>

<p>This study seeks to determine the effectiveness of the CRC's Directions Program in facilitating lasting change and meeting the needs of its clients during the current financial grant years. The objective of this research project is to begin to determine the impact the Directions Program has on its clients and their families. This will help to identify specific procedures and interventions which need improvement at all levels. Furthermore, it is to give a voice to former clients and their families about their experiences at the CRC.</p>

<p>The research question guiding this project seeks to determine the effectiveness of the CRC's Directions Program in facilitating lasting change and meeting the needs of its clients during the financial grant years of 2006-2008. Four hypotheses are used to explore this research question: (1) the Directions Program had a positive impact on the clients who completed and participated in the program, (2) completing the Directions Program has a positive impact on client's relationship with their families, (3) the use of one or more referrals is positively correlated to lasting improvement in the client's family relationships, and (4) the use of one or more referrals is positively correlated to lasting improvement in the client's lives. These hypotheses are not testable due to the low response rate received on the surveys.</p>

<p>The participants were former clients of the CRC's Directions Program as well as their legal guardians. There were approximately 135 participants, 128 of which are former clients with ages ranging from 13-17 while in the program. The participants were all the former clients who went through the CRC's Directions Program between October 1, 2006 and September 30, 2008. In addition, seven legal guardians participated in the study. All participants were asked to participate in both quantitative and qualitative parts of this research including a survey and an in-depth interview. Furthermore, demographic, programmatic, and historical information was gathered from the files of these 128 clients.</p>

<p>The surveys were developed by the research team. They elicited information on the participants' perceptions of the services received by the Directions Program. These included their perceptions on group, family, and individual therapies in addition to participation in referrals and relationships with staff. After approval by the Eastern Washington Universities Institutional Review Board, the surveys were mailed out to the homes of former clients and their legal guardians. A cover letter, information sheet, and permission slip to contact clients regarding the in-depth interview were included with the surveys. Two follow-up mailings were sent-out.</p>

<p>Descriptive statistics were run on the data received from the files of the former clients. These included demographic, programmatic, and data regarding presenting issues and history. Frequencies and means were taken on the various data. This analysis was run on SPSS 17.0 and Microsoft Excel 2007.</p>

<p>Though the hypotheses were not testable, biviariate analysis was conducted on data received from client files. This analysis was utilized to determine if the Directions Program fulfilled its purpose to meet the needs of clients in an effective way. Pearson Chi-Square tests and cross tabulations were conducted on information presented by the client and services provided by the Directions Program using SPSS 17.0.</p>

<h2 id="findings">Findings</h2>

<p>The clients were between the ages 13 and 17 and the majority (24.2%) of them were 14. There were 21.88 percent who were 16. Both ages 15 and 17 made up 19.53 percent each. The least frequent client age was 13 (14.8%). Sixty-seven clients were female while 57 were male. One client identified as transgender. Most (63%) of the clients reported being Caucasian. Other race/ethnicities made up a relatively small percentage of clients serviced by the Directions Program (see Figure 1).</p>

<p>The clients spent an average of 190.30 hours (see Table 1) in the program. Within the various modalities, there is a disparity between the different treatments. The average time spent in family sessions was 2.65 hours (see Table 2). Clients spent on average 4.98 hours (see Table 3) in group. Additionally clients spent an average of 5.03 hours in individual sessions (see Table 4).</p>

<p>Clients came into the program with varying backgrounds and social histories (see Table 5). For example, 56 of the clients had problems with school and 22 had been abused or neglected by their parents. In addition, the clients indicated they were dealing with various critical issues (see Table 6). The majority of the clients (120) indicated that they were dealing with issues at home concerning family dynamics. Also 60 participants indicated that they were dealing with school issues. Thirty-one had issues with alcohol and drug abuse.</p>

<p>The CRC often serves homeless youth. During the researched years about 16.4 percent of their population had issues regarding housing and shelter as a critical issue. Of the homeless youth the CRC served during the researched years 33.4 percent had issues with school (either attending school irregularly, having dropped out, or been suspended or expelled from school). While the correlation between these two variables are not significant in this research project, displaying a Pearson Chi-Square score of 0.351, it has shown a significant link in previous research as discussed earlier. Furthermore, of the homeless youth the CRC served during the researched years, 23.8 percent had issues related to the mental health status of youth or family members. Of the youth who had mental health issues, 14.3 percent of them were homeless.</p>

<p>Household dynamics issues was a common critical issue for the participants (see Table 7). A little over a quarter of the youth with household dynamics as an issue did not participate in any family session hours (see Table 8). Similar to family sessions, a little over a quarter of youth with household dynamics as an issue only participated in one hour or less of group sessions. The independent variable of family dynamics appears to be spread evenly between both hours of family and group sessions.</p>

<p>Research has also shown family sessions to be correlated to positive outcomes with youth who have issues with substance use/abuse (see Figure 2). The Pearson Chi-Square test showed a score of 0.537 and 0.636 respectively for the youth having a social history of alcohol use/abuse and drug use/abuse. For the critical issue of alcohol and other drug abuse the score was much higher: 0.907. The number of family sessions based on substance abuse is spread evenly between the various times of both family and group sessions</p>

<p>Clients report on possible alcohol and/or drug use/abuse issues through reporting on social history and critical issues. The CRC provides two different services to address substance use/abuse issues, either in-house or through referrals. These two treatments are substance abuse assessment and/or treatment (SAAT) through an assessment and treatment to stop substance abuse. Substance abuse prevention (SAP) includes skill building and educational activities (see Table 9).</p>

<h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h2>

<p>The Crisis Residential Center in Spokane is a social safety net for the community and communities regionally. In the CRC's three different programs, they facilitate tens of thousands of hours of services for youth being involved in their program. Clients spent a total of a little over 11,500 hours in the Directions Program during 2007 alone. These numbers grow exponentially when the other two programs included. The CRC provided hundreds of hours of individual, group, and family sessions. During 2007, these numbers were respectively about 450, 320, and 175 hours for the Directions Program.</p>

<p>Due to the fact these hours provide services for such a vulnerable population, it is imperative they provide the most respectful and effective services. To provide effective services an agency's program model ought to be based on research. Based on the findings of this research project, there are a number of recommendations for both further exploration and program development. These recommendations fall under five basic sections.</p>

<p>First, the researchers recommend the CRC Directions Program examine avenues to better involve their participants in aftercare services. They advocate for the CRC to enhance their capability to refer individuals to services they find useful or are more satisfied with. This may include a need for future researchers to examine various referrals utilized and their effectiveness. As described in the review of literature, aftercare and referrals are found to provide positive outcomes for clients. Only 12 percent of the youth sampled participated in aftercare services. For the limited number of clients who participated in the two surveys, not all of them followed through with provided referrals. Regarding the former client survey, three of the four participants described themselves as having partaken in the referrals provided by the CRC. The legal guardian surveys showed five of the seven participants described themselves as following though with the referrals made by the CRC Directions Program. Only two of these five were very satisfied with the referrals that were made or the services provided.</p>

<p>Second, the researchers would promote the CRC to utilize the status of the homelessness as indicators for youth possibly needing either academic support and/or help with mental health issues. Specifically the researchers recommend the CRC explore ways of improving the academic capacity and school status of the youth and provide a way of tracking youth's improvement or devolution. It is also recommended that the CRC's Directions Program refer clients with mental health issues to agencies with staff able to properly treat the presenting issues. As discussed previously, these recommendations are backed up by the findings.</p>

<p>Third, the researchers recommend examining the techniques staff uses to involve youth and families in group and family sessions. Research associates group and family counseling with positive outcomes in regards to issues related to household dynamics. Despite the link between group and family counseling and positive outcomes, people who had household dynamics as a critical issue did not receive more hours of service.</p>

<p>The numbers of clients who had household dynamics is spread evenly though the hours of group and family sessions (see Figure 2 for family sessions). This almost equal distribution places over a quarter of the youth who did not participate in any hours of family sessions. Similarly over a quarter of the youth participated in one hour or less of group. Some of the youth who start the program, go on the run before completing the program. Some of these youth leave relatively early in the placement, 17 percent having left within the first 48 hours. This percentage may account for some of the youth who did not receive group or family sessions, but does account for the quarter of them that did not receive these basic services. Including these numbers, more than 50 percent participated in two or less hours of family sessions or four or less hours of group.</p>

<p>Similar to household dynamic issues connection to group and family counseling in research, positive outcomes linked group and family sessions and changing negative substance issues. Substance use and/or abuse has been found to be strongly correlated to the hours of group and family sessions. The data presented similar problems to household dynamics and its relationship to group and family session hours.</p>

<p>Fourth, the researchers would recommend the CRC evaluate how they work with people who have substance use and/or abuse either as the participant's social history or as their critical issue. Specifically it may benefit the CRC to offer SAAT services to a larger percentage of the youth with substance abuse and or use issues. It may also benefit the CRC to be more directive in who they offer SAP services to (see Table 9).</p>

<p>Substance abuse assessment and or treatment had only five clients (16.1 percent of those with substance abuse as a critical issue) participated in the SAAT services. The percentage of youth who had a critical issue of drug and alcohol abuse and did not receive SAAT was 83.9. The Directions Program, in accordance with federal law, develops individualized service plans for each of the youth who participate in their program. While this is true, it appears they have trouble with youth who have substance use and/or abuse issues. A larger number of participants in the Directions Program participated in SAP, a total of 27. For youth without a social history of alcohol and or drug use and/or abuse, almost 30 percent participated in SAP. Only seven and 13 percent had a social history respectively of alcohol and/or drug use and/or abuse who received SAP.</p>

<p>Fifth, the researchers recommend a few improvements apart from the service delivery systems. A) Improve completeness and clearness of files. Many files were missing various pieces of data that were in other files. There were also often mistakes or inconsistencies in the data provided. B) Develop a method of tracking successful work with youth, and incorporate it into paper work to improve future studies. C) Incorporate more evidence based practices into the individual, group, and family sessions. In preparing for this research, the researchers were unable to describe a single theory base for any of the various interventions used. Using specific evidence based programs which are shown to be effective with this population can improve the overall effectiveness of the CRC. D) The researchers would also recommended that the CRC perform routine follow up on the services provided and have a way of documenting the follow-up for future analysis. Finally E) the CRC's Direction Program might benefit from producing more research and follow up regarding both the Directions Program and the other two programs.</p>

<h2 id="implicationsforsocialwork">Implications for Social Work</h2>

<p>This study provided the basis for future research that would more clearly determine the effectiveness of programs that focus on at-risk youth. The study gathered a variety of information on the former clients to get an accurate picture of their needs and programmatic involvement. It demonstrates the need for agencies to know their clients in order to provide effective service. Furthermore, it demonstrates the possible interrelatedness of various elements in the lives of at-risk youth.</p>

<p>Also, this project indicates the importance of collaboration between agencies. As demonstrated earlier, referrals play an important role in family reunification. Furthermore, clients may present with multiple issues. No agency is equipped to deal with every issue presented. Collaboration among agencies in a community is an excellent way to create wrap-around services.</p>

<p>Finally, this study reveals the importance of staff competency. For example, a participant indicated on the surveys that he/she wished that the family session facilitator was more knowledgeable and effective. Particularly important for social workers is to follow the NASW Code of Ethics (2009) which stresses competency in practice.</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>

<p>Though this study can be applied to the profession in a general, there are some limitations to consider. The researchers received a low response rate to the surveys which limited their ability to correlate participants' perceptions of the Directions Program to the information gathered from their files. This made it impossible to determine the validity of the hypotheses. Time was another limitation. With more time, the researchers would have attempted other avenues to increase the response rate for the surveys. In addition, many of the surveys were returned due to outdated contact information. Social bias seems to be an additional limitation. It is unclear how much the responses of the participants' were influenced by their desire to leave a favorable impression of them or their child. Furthermore, the surveys were created by the researchers and were not pilot tested. Their validity is unclear and there was no control group to improve the overall internal validity of the study.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The limitations of this study weigh into the conclusions that can be drawn from the data. The number of surveys that were returned affects the ability to correlate the variables and fully utilize the robust data set. Regardless of this fact there are still quantifiable implications for social work. The CRC's Directions Program, the entire CRC, and other social service agencies that serve similar populations, can implement the recommendations. If the CRC was to implement some of these, they may become more effective. While there is a need for further research, there is also a need to appreciate the services provided by the CRC. The legal guardian survey had some of the following comments.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Having CRC there in a time that my child was running out of control provided a time for her to stop in her path, give her some things to think about &amp; became the turning point for my daughter to move towards the right path again which she is thankfully on again. CRC is a facility that I feel was a very, very important component in getting everyone to stop what was happening, take a breath, &amp; make a plan on how things were going to be handled."</p>
  
  <p>"I feel CRC saved us on a couple of occasions giving our daughter a place to be when she just didn't feel she could be at home. It gave us all a break during a very long &amp; hard time with our issues. We are very thankful CRC exists!"</p>
</blockquote>

      <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nationally over 1.5 million youth runaway and put themselves in dangerous situations such as substance abuse. Research shows that this is in a large part due to problems within the family unit. Many interventions assist in reunifying the family and improving dangerous or maladaptive behaviors including family and group therapies. Spokane's Crisis Residential Center attempts to assist this population by encouraging family reunification. One way in which they do this is through the Directions Program. This study evaluates the Directions Program to determine its effectiveness in serving at-risk youth and their families. Surveys were sent out to 128 former clients and their families.</p>]]></excerpt:encoded>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>Poverty is an over arching social issue that affect people in many ways. Stress has often been associated with poverty. This relationship is explored through Kozol (1995) and his experiences with children in an impoverished neighborhood. The children he describes have bio-psycho-social risk &amp; resilience factors in regards to stress and poverty. Stress and poverty can be put into an ecological perspective utilizing functionalist theory. Functionalist theory is limited in implementing a planed change process with a client. Utilizing empowerment theory works to both help the client understand there issue and they aren't the only one with the issue (much like functionalism). It goes further to help create a planned change process for the client and to continue that process at the macro level.</p>

<h2 id="thestressofpovertyacasestudyusingamazinggrace">The Stress of Poverty: A Case Study Using Amazing Grace</h2>

<p>Barusch (2006) talks about children who grow up in some of the United States' most impoverished areas suffer from a variety of mental and health related ills. Poverty has been associated with low birth weight, increased infant mortality, nutritional deficits. AIDS and other infectious diseases are also often associated at higher rates with people in poverty. Kozol (1995) describes the lives children who are growing up in just such impoverished areas. As he relates to their lives he uncovers many of the stressors that are in place due to poverty.</p>

<p>The abject poverty that the children he explains shows stressors at every turn. Ballas (2006) defines stress as "a feeling of emotional or physical tension." (Definition section, ¶ 1) These tensions can be both emotional and or physical. This means, simply put that they can have effect on your mental and or bodily health. Moore (n.d.) breaks the concept of stress down into three different categories. The first two categories deal with the stresses of daily life. First acute stress is a non-consistant stress that can come from a variety of sources. Second chronic stress occurs when one suffers from the same acute stress consistently over time. Third traumatic stress deals with an overwhelming tragedy. People who suffer from traumatic stresses can often be diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>

<h2 id="biopsychosocialriskresiliencefactors">Bio-psycho-social Risk &amp; Resilience Factors</h2>

<p>The common quote saying "when it rains, it pours" seems to be very true of stress and can be especially true of the stressors related to poverty. Kozol's (2006) kids many different stressors that affect them. These stressors are contestant in their lives and often can be considered chronic. Sometimes, they have a pouring down of various seemingly unrelated acute stressors. Most all of the kids experienced at least one stressor that many would consider traumatic.</p>

<p>The stressors that these children experienced can be described as risk factors. All of the children described experience some of the same biological risk factors. 1.) The children's living conditions and neighborhoods were risk factors. These issues included the general dirtiness of the neighborhood (all of the things found on the sidewalks). 2.) The pollution from the incinerator and the city dump could also be called risk factors. 3.) The disproportionate number of neighborhood members with AIDS and other diseases could be another risk factor. It is important to describe people and topics in a holistic fashion. When talking about risk factors there is a need for the comparison of resilience factors. 1.) A community that helps each other when they are in need is an important resilience factor. Mrs. Washington's sickness shows a bit of this. Her son acts as her caregiver. Also other members of the community stop by and sometimes attempt to help out their family.</p>

<p>Biological risk factors are associated more physical health, psychological risk factors are more associated with the emotional health. 1.) Instability and constant need. Both of these lead to chronic stress for the children. 2.) A lack of positive adult role models. This gives the children few examples to follow after and nobody to help them process the stresses that they are going though. Sometimes when dealing with risk &amp; resilience factors, the same one will show up on both sides. The adults that are in the children's lives are a resilience factor. One place that this can be seen is with the members of Saint Ann's Church.</p>

<p>Social risk factors focus on interaction with groups of people. Gangs and violence are both social risk factors. Lack of access to social services is another social risk factor (health care, social service workers, and police officers). A good example of a social resilience factor would be Church.</p>

<h2 id="stressofpovertyfunctionalism">Stress of Poverty &amp; Functionalism</h2>

<p>According to Rogers (2006) functionalism explains how the aspects of society work together to maintain stability. "Specifically, functionalist theory is concerned with the ways in which values, norms, institutions, and organizations contribute to the overall good of society." (p. 90) Functionalism is very focused on describing societal needs for perceived social problems, but lacks considerably in being able to advocate for clients who are in those perceived social problems.</p>

<p>The social problem of stress accredited to poverty would be explained from various points of view if a functionalist was working with a client. They might start by talking about the city dump and incinerator being placed in the neighborhood with the client as follows; their neighborhood is the best place for those facilities because it helps keep the stability of the overall environment. Their neighborhood allows for the most cost effective position, not needing to worry about costly upper class neighborhoods (land, payment to workers, and the fight to keep them out). They would explain that because the company benefited, that the overall city is in better shape. Maybe they would talk about the possible jobs that are close for the neighborhood.</p>

<p>Rogers (2006) describes five criteria for judging theories, they must; be functional, strong, parsimonious, falsifiable, and make practical sense. Firstly, the functionalist theory does have clarity or ridged specifics integrated in its use. It is non-functional for bringing about social change or reform. Secondly, functionalism is not strong, because it does not allow you to make predictions about behavior. It only allows the user to look back at previous experiences and find out why they happened. Thirdly, functional does allow for it to be integrated with previous theories such as systems theory and the ecological perspective. Fourthly, functionalism is not falsifiable. The concepts involved to not allow for empirical observations. Fifthly, most of the time it does not make practical sense for the social worker to attempt to help client. Functionalism can be would be useful to help the client understand the systems at work in their situation.</p>

<h2 id="stressofpovertyempowermenttheory">Stress of Poverty &amp; Empowerment Theory</h2>

<p>Aria (1997) describes five stages of empowerment theory. The first two stages focus on the client and problem interaction. She defines them as experiencing powerlessness and coming to awareness. The third stage is where the social worker client interaction is the focus, she titles it connecting and learning. The forth and fifth stages are where the client takes their new skills and reaches out with them. She labels them as mobilization / action and contribution.</p>

<p>Empowerment theory could be used to both reduce and eventually reduce stress in relationship to poverty. First the client would need to be in the situation, before they can get out of it. Then, there must be a realization that they are both suffering from the stress related to poverty and that they are not the only ones who are suffering. This also includes a desire for change. To be able to change, there is a need to learn new skills. Some possible skills could be stress management techniques, better budgeting skills, team building and advocacy skills (to help rid their community of unwanted facilities and gain better access to social services), vocational / educational training, and a host of other possibilities. Then they need to implement the skills that you taught them and be spend there time contributing to others who are in the same position that they were in. This works in both the individual's life, and moves out to become a macro fix for the social problem at hand.</p>

      <title>Job Skills Training for Juvenile Offenders: An Analysis of SB 5370</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="jobskillstrainingforjuvenileoffendersananalysisofsb5370">Job Skills Training for Juvenile Offenders: An Analysis of SB 5370</h1>

<p>You can read a downloadable version of this article:  <a href="/s/job-skills-training-juvenile-offenders-analysis-sb-5370.pdf">Job Skills Training for Juvenile Offenders: An Analysis of SB 5370</a>.</p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>The concerns of juveniles involved in the justice system are often topics of discussion in regards to rehabilitation. SB 5370 addresses job skills training for juvenile offenders as a method of rehabilitation. The process that the bill went through has been fair. The indirect/direct &amp; immediate/long-term costs and benefits show promise for this piece of legislation. It works for juveniles on improving their work related skills and promoting a vulnerable population.</p>

<h2 id="overviewofsb5370">Overview of SB 5370</h2>

<p>There are many different offenses that juveniles commit to become involved in the juvenile justice system. Juveniles come from many various family structures, living conditions, financial demographics, and over all environments that they live in.</p>

<p>Senators Shin (D), Berkey (D), Rasmussen (D), and Kline (D) introduced SB 5370 to help bring change to the Juvenile Rehabilitation Administration (JRA). This bill would create a program for offenders to help them with building skills in life and in the work force. The requirements that would be required to be met are as follows;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) the educational programs offered are occupationally based and provide a wide-range of prevocational skills necessary to career development; (2) the vocational skills obtained are transferable to entering the market; (3) the basic skill offerings include remedial and advanced skills in workplace communications, negotiation, teamwork, and problem solving.
  SB. 5370, 2007</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also mentioned in the SB 5370 that by providing these types of program it would help the offenders come back into the community without a violent behavior and also create a great opportunity for them to gain good skills in their future employments. The director JRA and the affected school districts need to implement a process for evaluating how the juveniles are progressing in self-management skills, employability skills, and life skills. The students will earn high school credits, skills in working with local businesses and local organizations, and an awareness of possible career paths. This will give the youth invaluable experience opportunities to enhance their employment marketability. The created program will be linked with the Employment Security Department, the Office of the Super Superintendent of Public Instruction, and the Workforce Training and Education Coordinating Board. They will consult together to create a detailed out line on the specifics of the program, the layout of how the skills will be taught, and verify that the staff is well trained. These programs will be offered to any students between the ages 14 to 21 with this program being based on teaching job skills for the future use in the working market (SB 5370, 2007).</p>

<h2 id="fairprocess">Fair Process</h2>

<p>When looking at any piece of legislation, it is important to look into the process that the legislation went through to be created. The process that a piece of legislation goes through varies with the type of legislation that it is, and the system that it is going though. Some systems are more formal, such as legislation at the federal level. Legislation that is at a state or local level often has a less bureaucratic process that it must go through. Barusch (2006) describes three principles that must be looked at to decide if the process is fair.</p>

<p>The first fair process principle is that all individuals need to be treated as political equals. This means that each party has a chance to vote. Washington State has a representative legislature, meaning the officials are elected by the citizens to represent the people. The House of Representatives and the Senate both have rules govern every member. Each of the members are treated as political equals.</p>

<p>The second fair process principle is that all the parties affected by the piece of legislation should have a voice in the decision. In regards to SB 5370 this happened to an extent. The bill went to a public hearing in the Senate Committee on Early Learning &amp; K-12 Education. During that hearing there was public testimony from members of many of the affected government agencies. For example members of the following agencies testified; DSHS, Washington Federation of State Employees, and Community Youth Services (Bratton, 2007). Although there were many of the agencies testifying, there was no testimony opposing the bill. This could be due to the nature of the bill, that it is generally accepted and desired or it could be that those who were against the legislation were not allowed to testify.</p>

<p>The third fair process principle is that there needs to be formal rules that should apply equally to all parties in similar situations. This is true for both the Senate and the House of Representatives in Washington State.</p>

<h2 id="costsandbenefits">Costs and Benefits</h2>

<p>The impact of this piece of legislation is that juveniles will be taught skills to survive in the work force. The juvenile offenders will be given the opportunity to gain modern knowledge that wasn't maybe obtained before they entering the juvenile justice system. Jobs skills training programs also often decrease the status of the juvenile re offending (Schofield, 2006). As with any program, there needs to be an analysis of the costs and benefits.</p>

<p>The cost of enacting this program will have an immediate/direct cost for the director of the school district. For example he will have less time to work on other school related activities because of the planning of this new program. This legislation will be give the school director nine new responsibilities. An example of long-term/direct cost would be the need for ongoing revision of the. Immediate/in-direct cost would be a struggle for teachers to get adjusted to the implications and requirements of the new program. The schools would have a long-term/ indirect cost of keeping up with the necessary supplies to keep the program running.</p>

<p>One of the immediate/direct benefits that this program has is it will help juveniles gain skills in the work environment and obtain a job. A long-term/direct benefit is that the youth will be able to go into the work environment ready to do work because of the skills gained in the program. An immediate/indirect benefit is the community will be having juveniles working building up the economy. A long-term/indirect benefit would be that the community might have less crime committed by juveniles because of this program. The JRA's director costs have more to do with a human perspective, due to the larger work load. The benefits form the juveniles perspective works both from a human perspective and a monetary one.</p>

<h2 id="impactonvulnerablepopulations">Impact on Vulnerable Populations</h2>

<p>The National Association of Social Workers (1999) code of ethics describes the social justice as a social worker value. They state that social workers should pursue social change "particularly with and on behalf of vulnerable and oppressed individuals and groups of people" (p. 5). With this in mind it is imperative that any analysis of social policy look at the potential or actual impact of the legislation on vulnerable populations. Juveniles are routinely regarded as vulnerable populations. SB 5370 has the intention to affect the juvenile offenders in a positive way. Schofield (2006) describes one job retraining program as having 75% of their participants as staying crime free.</p>

<p>Looking at the impact of legislation on vulnerable populations means looking at the components of social justice. Miller describes four components to look at when trying to find the balance of social justice. The components are desert, need, rights, and equality (as cited in Barush, 2006, pp. 8 – 9). Deserts deals with what is deserved by the impacted group. Juvenile offenders deserve to be incarcerated and punished for their crimes. Needs deal with what is needed by the targeted group. Although juvenile offenders deserve to be incarcerated they really need to be taught new skills and empowered to not continue as a reoccurring part of the system. Rights deals with what people are entitled to. This can be slightly tricky when talking about people who break the law. When somebody breaks the law, they lose a majority of their rights. For example with some crimes the offender can lose the right to bear arms or vote. Equality deals with the equal distribution to impacted groups. This legislation does not seem to unequally favor one group over another but distributes the services equally to those in need.</p>

<p>Juveniles are a valuable group that needs to be carefully looked at when legislation is proposed in regards to them. Juveniles involved in the justice system are even more vulnerable. Although SB 5370 is not meet the highest qualifications for all of Miller's four components of social justice, the balance still comes out on the favor of being socially just. It help our youth be less involved in the justice system and offered more job skill opportunities. This is a bill that should be passed by Washington's legislature.</p>

<p>You can read a downloadable version of this article:  Working with Diverse Populations: <a href="/s/juveniles-involved-juvenile-justice-system-v2bl.pdf">Juvenile's Involved in the Justice System</a>.</p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>Working with a diverse population requires the social worker examine aspects that make up the population. To fully examine a population, a few of the aspects that should be researched are as follows; best practices for working with the population, cultural background, tradition, norms and values, history of oppression, types of support, family dynamics, spirituality, and body language. The stories that fill Humes book come and address each of these aspects at different points.</p>

<h2 id="demographicsandpopulationofjuvenileoffenders">Demographics and Population of Juvenile Offenders</h2>

<p>In the United States there is a large population of youth that are involved in the juvenile justice system. In the U.S. the ages associated with youths are defined state by state. The majority of the states define juveniles as under 18. Juveniles are incarcerated in juvenile detentions for various crimes that they commit. Depending on the severity of the crime the juvenile commits, they can also be moved into adult court. According to Elias (2006) "[s]ince 1982, every state but Nebraska has made it easier to try juvenile as adults, and most states have legalized harsher sentences" (p. D9). Many states limit judge's discretion by sending all teens who commit serious crimes to adult court (Elias, 2006). Juveniles in American consist of a range of demographics including; types of race and ethnicity, sex, age, area of residence, family histories and structure, and the crimes that they commit.</p>

<p>As of 2002 in America there are an estimated 72,894,500 persons that were under the age of 18 and considered juveniles. Juveniles make up 25% of the population of the United States (Snyder &amp; Sickmund, 2006). So juveniles are an important factor to our society because they will be our future. "Current projections indicate that the juvenile population will continue to grow through out the 21st century." The Census Bureau estimates that it will increase 14% between 2000 and 2025 and then in 2050 the juvenile population will have grown 36% from the 2000 population (Snyder &amp; Sickmund, 2006).</p>

<p>When juveniles commit various criminal offenses, they are arrested and can be charged as an adult. Fagan (2005) describes that adolescents think and behave differently from adults. He states that teens "are risk-takers who inflate the benefits of crime and sharply discount its consequences, even when they know the law" (p. A6). Research shows that teen brain remains immature through early adulthood. "These new studies have zeroed in on the areas of the brain where impulsivity, risk taking, and poor social judgment are regulated" (p. A6). Although some juveniles are charged as adults it is much more common to for them to commit less serious offenses.</p>

<p>In 2003 law enforcement agencies reported 2.2 million arrests of persons under the age of 18 (Snyder &amp; Sickmund, 2006). The male population was the most common offender noted by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (2005a). They reported 897,305 young men verses 381,643 young women who were arrested. The race of those arrested are as follows; 67.5% white, 29.9% black, 1.3% American Indian and 1.3% Asian (United States FBI, 2005b). The common offenses committed by males are property crimes. Property crimes include burglary, motor vehicle theft and arson. The other offenses (except traffic) that males committed most commonly are larceny-theft and assaults. For males the least common offenses were embezzlement, gambling, suspicion and prostitution. Females most commonly committed offenses are property crimes, larceny-theft and assaults. The least common offenses were those of suspicion, murder and non-negligent manslaughter, forcible rape, and gambling (United States FBI, 2005a).</p>

<p>In the United States Delaware, Florida, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and California have the highest juvenile crime arrest rates (Snyder &amp; Sickmund, 2006). In recent research is has been noted that there is a connection between poverty and juvenile delinquency. For example, as cited in Snyder and Sickmund (2006) low income families had more commonly self-reported violence in their younger years then those not of low socio economic status. These same low income families also had higher rates of convictions for violent offenses. "Research, however, indicates that the linkage may not be direct" (p. 7). The Free Child Project (2007) said that family disruption has a direct influence on juvenile violence and adult violence. The youngest children are the most likely to live under the poverty threshold. "16% of juvenile's ages 5-17 lived in thresholds with resources below the established poverty thresholds" (p. 8). The family structure is another corollary factor that seems to determine whether juveniles act out with violent crimes. "Youth ages 12-17 who lived in families with both biological parents were, in general, less likely than youth in other families report a variety of problem behaviors, such as running away from home, sexual activity, major theft, assault and arrest."</p>

<h2 id="juvenilejusticeintheunitedstates">Juvenile Justice in the United States</h2>

<p>The United States does not have many laws regarding juvenile justice which take federal jurisdiction. The U.S. Government empowers each states to choose the best modality of working with juvenile offenders (Cornell Law School, 2006). Even though the legislature creates the laws for each state, it is the courts that determine the meaning and acceptance of the law. The Judicial Ethics Committee in Tennessee explained, "[o]nly the courts can make a determination as to whether or not a law is constitutional or unconstitutional, ethical or unethical. It is not a matter for local officials to unilaterally determine" (Judge oversees juvenile program, 2007). U.S. Code Title 42 Chapter 72 deals with Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. Specifically it states law in regards to the following; programs and offices, runaway and homeless youth, missing children, incentive grants for local delinquency prevention programs, and public outreach (Cornell Law School, n.d.). Although there is an amount of federal legislation, it leaves a vast amount of variation for each of the states to have their own system.</p>

<p>The Juvenile Justice Act of 1977 was a piece of legislation passed in Washington. This act was a complicated set of legislation that dealt with a broad range of topics such as; juvenile courts, jurisdiction, payments, types of infractions, reinvestment programs and many more topics. The Juvenile Justice Act of 1977 is a part of the Revised Code of Washington (RCW) Title 13. This title is all of the legislation that has happened in Washington State since 1977 (United States WA Leg, 2007). One of the unique structures in Washington is that it is the only state to use a determinate sentencing structure in committing juvenile offenders. The determinate sentencing means that there is a minimum and a maximum sentence. The length of the sentence is determined using a point system, it the "offenses seriousness and criminal history into account. Ordinarily, standard range sentences are applied based on the offender's point level" (United States WA DSHS, 2006).</p>

<p>The juvenile justice system tends to focus more on rehabilitation then punishment. In Washington State the Department of Social &amp; Health Services houses the Juvenile Rehabilitation Administration (JRA). This office manages residential treatment programs, community programs, parole services, treatment services, and administrative programs. These services and programs are housed through four divisions; institutional programs, community programs, operations support services, treatment and intergovernmental programs.</p>

<h2 id="juvenilejusticesystemincanada">Juvenile Justice System in Canada</h2>

<p>Just as every individual state in the United States has different laws that govern the juvenile justice system, so does every nation state. Free Child Project (2007) as a part of their statistics used for advocacy explain that the United States is one of only 6 other nations that have executed juvenile offenders in the last 15 years. Canada, although they are close to America in being physically and often ideologically have different focus' for their juvenile system.</p>

<p>According to Creechan and Silverman (2005) the juvenile systems of the United States and Canada were very close since their inceptions. In 1960, they took fundamental ideological differences. "Canada came to place much more emphasis on legal aspects of juvenile delinquency while the United States stressed the importance of innovative solutions for treatment" (Directions taken by the United States and Canada vary section, ¶ 1). The United States promoted programs, while Canada changed the law code associated with juvenile offense. Canada also tends to focus on legislation from a federal level, verses a province level. The United States gives the majority of the power to each state to decide what the best course of action is.</p>

<p>Canada first juvenile justice legislation was the Juvenile Delinquents Act in 1908. In 1965 a report entitled Juvenile Delinquency in Canada was the culmination of recommended views on legal changes the government should make. This led to the introduction of bill C-192, the Young Offenders Act. It was not passed and criticized by groups as "too legalistic and punitive and as a ‘Criminal Code for children'" (Canada DOJ, 2005). The Young Offenders Act (YOA) of 1984 was the next piece of legislation to be passed in regards to juvenile justice. The YOA of 1984 was "widely heralded as ushering in a ‘new era,' or even a ‘revolution,' in Canadian juvenile justice" (p. 219). Some of the sections of this legal code made the juvenile legislation constitutional again. Some of the previous juvenile code was deemed unconstitutional when Canada enacted the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms amendment to their constitution. This is similar to the US Bill of rights. The Youth Criminal Justice Act came into being in 2003. This again replaced the YOA of 1984. Some of the changes included in the 2003 law are as follows; using the formal justice system more selectively, reducing the over-reliance on incarceration and increasing reintegration of young people into the community following custody (Canada DOJ, 2005).</p>

<p>Juveniles are important part of our society and do commit crimes, crimes that serious and some that are not. Juveniles are arrested and taken into custody which cost Americans financially and socially to incarcerate them.</p>

<p>A downloadable version of this article can be read: <a href="/s/single-system-design-example.pdf">Turn Your Life Upside Down: An Individual Design Study</a>.</p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>An example of an Single System Design Study implemented using the following criteria;</p>

<p><strong>Theory</strong>: Using a check list and acquiring weekly personal accountability will help me to reach some of the goals that I would like to obtain.</p>

<p><strong>Plan</strong>: Implement a personal growth checklist into my life, to help me keep some of the various aspects of my life in balance. The specific areas that I would like to work on are as follows; </p>

<ol>
<li>Read my bible daily</li>
<li>Read my utmost for my highest every morning</li>
<li>Eat one Salad or Smoothie as a meal each day</li>
<li>Hit the snooze no more than once a morning</li>
<li>Exercise five times per week for at least 30 minutes</li>
<li>Meet with accountability partner once per week</li>
</ol>

<p>By having a weekly checklist and somebody to be my accountability partner, I will be more likely to accomplish the preceding goals then if I was just to attempt to do the same things without any other change in my life. </p>

<h2 id="individualdesignstudymethods">Individual Design Study Methods</h2>

<p>Turn your life upside down, is a series of self care changes that were implemented in Jacob Campbell's life. Campbell is 24 year old male college student attending Eastern Washington's School of Social Work. The study attempted to look at five aspects of his life that he attempts to do regularly. Each of these components of his life are not always followed but general goals he has had for his life for a number of years. The components studied are as follows; the number of snoozes used, daily bible reading, replacing a meal for a smoothie or salad, and finally five exercise activities per week. The fifth area studied was Campbell's reading of a daily devotional . This was left out due to never once reading it though out the entire study.</p>

<p>To track Campbell's practice of each of these topics figure one was filled out on a daily basis's. The very act of participating in this activity causes a possible confound for the study. It itself seems to be a type of intervention. The intervention used was an accountability partner and weekly meetings. The concept is that if Campbell had to discuss either his failure or his success with another person, he would be more likely to participate in the helpful behaviors and not the unhelpful ones (hitting the snooze button).</p>

<p>The studies length was four weeks, from 30 April to 27 May. The first two weeks, were to gain a baseline and have some data points to compare to the data after the intervention. Figures 2 – 5 section A shows this baseline. Section B of figures 2 – 5 shows the studied points after the intervention. The x axis shows the days of the study. The y axis shows the number of times each of the various studied aspects was done. Utilizing the snooze button was the only negative based element studied. Figures 3 and 4 both are yes no questions. A one means that the activity was done and a zero means that Campbell did not participate in the activity. Figure 5 only has four plotted points. These points show the percentage of required exercise that Campbell completed. A score of one shows Campbell completing five out of five required exercises for the week.</p>

<h2 id="discussionofresults">Discussion of Results</h2>

<p>The study was to find out if Campbell was more likely to engage in the described healthy lifestyle activities if he was required to meet with an accountability partner. The intervention of an accountability partner showed to be very effective for Campbell. It showed no effect in regards to his use of a daily devotional. This can be summed up by some of his reactions to the study. "I just didn't feel like I've had enough time lately to fit in reading the devotional, even though it would have only really taken my less then 10 minutes" (31 May 2007, Personal communication).</p>

<p>Figure 2 looks at the amount of times that Campbell utilized his snooze button in the mornings. He stated that this was the most important change he was hoping to accomplish. During the entire study he hit the snooze as many as six times one morning. After the intervention, he only use more then his one snooze three times. These are spread out and seemed to be sporadic spikes. Before the intervention he only had sporadic days that he obtained his goal.</p>

<p>Figures 3 and 4 both looked at the yes no question of specific behaviors. Figure 3 was to see if Campbell replaced a meal with either a smoothie or salad. Before the intervention Campbell rarely replaced a meal. After the intervention, he only failed to replace a meal 2 days. Figure 4 looked at Campbell's daily reading of the Bible. To qualify he had to read at least one chapter, but often read multiple chapters. Before the intervention Campbell only missed a few days of bible reading, and missed even less then after the intervention.</p>

<p>Figure 5 describes Campbell's consistency in exercising. He was required to exercise at least five times a week. The graph itself makes it seem as if it is the most progressive activity. Due to the fact that it deals with a specific number of times exercising a week, it has fewer points then the other graphs. The graph represents the percentage of those five weekly exercise activities participated in per week. The one obtained on week 4 means that Campbell completed five out of five exercise activities. The requirements for the exercise activity is that Campbell participate for at least 30 minutes in some activity that raises his heart rate above normal levels.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>On the outside, it would seem that this experiment was a complete success. Campbell's meeting with an accountability partner on every level of the study boosted the results. It would seem likely that if Campbell was to continue with this study, that the results might go down again. Although two weeks gives a number plots to point in a chart, it does not mean that lasting change has been implemented.</p>

      <link>/resources/research-methods-evidence-based-practice</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="whyresearch">Why Research</h2>

<p>Research is a vital activity that must be done by all social workers. It is a social worker's ethical responsibility to have an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence_based_practice" title="Wikipedia's EBP Article">evidence based practice (EBP)</a> and to be abreast of what effective interventions are being implemented within their field. Research is addressed within a section of the <a href="http://www.socialworkers.org/" title="Office NASW Site">National Association of Social Workers</a> <a href="http://www.socialworkers.org/pubs/code/default.asp" title="Code of Ethics at NASW Site">code of ethics</a>. Evidence based practice means the practitioner critically examines the various theories used for working with clients, and they use methods that are based on researched concepts (unless the purpose is to look into more experimental techniques).</p>

<h2 id="helpcompletingresearch">Help Completing Research</h2>

<p>Looking into this concept of EBP, we see a couple of ways it can be implemented. This site showcases some of the assorted facets of completing research. The first place that a researcher must look is into the <a href="/resources/ethics-research" title="Ethics in Research">ethics of the research</a> proposed. It is vital to have some understanding of the <a href="/resources/research-description-research-types" title="Research Discription">purpose of the research </a>and the over arching <a href="/resources/research-description-research-types#types">types of research</a>. Much like the scientific method, there is also a <a href="/resources/overview-research-process" title="Research Process">research process</a> and a specific <a href="/resources/types-study-designs" title="Types of Research Design">design</a> model that must be followed. Although there are clear processes that ought to be followed in research, there are various <a href="/resources/paradigms-and-reasoning-types-research" title="Paradigms in Research">paradigms</a> in how research is thought about and different <a href="/resources/paradigms-and-reasoning-types-research#reasoning" title="Reasoning Types in Research">types of reasoning</a> used by social workers. One of the types of research studies is known as a <a href="/resources/single-system-design-studies" title="Single System Design Studies">single system design</a>. For your convince, there is also a section that showcases an <a href="/resources/abstracts/turn-your-life-upside-down-individual-design-study-abstract" title="Turn Your Life Upside Down: Individual Design Study">example of a single system design study</a> attempting to change habits in my life. With any study it is also imperative to <a href="/resources/determining-studies-internal-validity" title="Determining a Studies Internal Validity">determine the studies validity</a>. This is partially done though looking at <a href="/resources/sampling-and-population-research" title="Sampliling and Population in Research">sampling and population </a>and also at the a range of <a href="/resources/factors-affecting-measurement" title="Factors Affecting Measurment">factors affecting measurement</a>.</p>

<h2 id="examplesofresearchandevaluation">Examples of Research and Evaluation</h2>

<p>To further help your understanding there are some examples I have completed. First there is a <a href="/resources/abstracts/quality-assurance-survey-safe-harbor-crisis-nursery-abstract" title="Quality Assurance Survery">quality assurance survey</a> I utilized for an agency I was volunteering with and all the forms and process created for said study. Second there is the aforementioned <a href="/resources/abstracts/turn-your-life-upside-down-individual-design-study-abstract" title="Turn Your Life Upside Down: Individual Design Study">single system design example</a> with displays how a single system design study functions and operates and gives all the documents and data collected for my study on changing some of my own habits. Third there is a <a href="/resources/critical-article-review-supervisors-and-stress">critical article review</a> to demonstrate some of how to critically assess various aspects of a published journal article. Finally there for my Master's degree I completed a research project. This project took place at an agency in Spokane, <a href="http://yfaconnections.org/services.html" title="YFA Connections Home Page">Crisis Residential Center</a>, and is a program effectiveness study. This comprehensive document contains both an <a href="/resources/directions-program-evaluation-abstract" title="Directions Program Evaluation">executive summary</a> and a <a href="/resources/literature-review-and-methodology-abstract" title="Literature Review">literature review</a>. Along with these to papers, there is the data set, all of the forms and documents that were utilized for this project.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="levelsofleadershipaleadershipphilosophygroundedinintrospectiveinterpersonalandintrapersonalconcepts">Levels of Leadership: A Leadership Philosophy Grounded in Introspective, Interpersonal, and Intrapersonal Concepts</h2>

<p>You read the downloadable version of this article.  <a href="/s/levels-leadership-philosophy.pdf">Levels of Leadership: A Leadership Philosophy Grounded in Introspective, Interpersonal, and Intrapersonal Concepts</a></p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>I work with at-risk youth and their families at a short-term care facility. Most of the major issues that come up, especially during family sessions, are those relating to how people deal with other people. I would imagine this phenomenon of people-to-people issues is transferable to the rest of the earth’s population. My pastor one time commented that life would be a lot easier if it was not for all the people. Leadership and our interactions with other people and ideas are always interrelated.</p>

<p>Most people do not recognize all the leadership opportunities in their lives, or even view themselves as a leader. Each and everybody person is a leader to a degree, and can improve their skills at leading. If dealing with other people is one of the major issues of the human race and it can often be defined by leadership, then it makes the topic of leadership a paramount one that everybody ought to examine.</p>
  
       [caption id="" align="alignnone" width="800.0"]<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51dcde94e4b09506a9c98fbc/525af6cbe4b077ec7f4a4a44/528edec1e4b02543d3a4b44b/1385094852039/jacob-leadership-philosophy.jpg" alt=" The Graphical Display of Jacob's Leadership Style. "/>  The Graphical Display of Jacob's Leadership Style. [/caption] 
  

<p>My leadership philosophy has three levels. Those levels are introspective, interpersonal, and Intrapersonal. The introspective deals with how we deal with ourselves and includes evaluating our own paradigms and being a purposeful leader. The major underlying paradigm is that leadership deals with influence. The interpersonal level deals with who we deal with other people. This level includes leadership/people skills, being a balanced leader, and people development. Finally the Intrapersonal level deals with people being interdependent and is really more of an outlook on life. The this outlook on life is that of being a servant leader.</p>

<h2 id="introspectivelevelofleadership">Introspective Level of Leadership</h2>

<p>Each and every person has different paradigms they have formed during their life. These paradigms as formed by our experience, context, basic/complex beliefs, and genetic factors in each of our lives. Each of these paradigms colors how we see the world and choose to interact with it. Some of these paradigms revolve around our concepts of people-to-people interactions. People who are effective in their lives tend to evaluate the paradigms that form the foundation for how they interact with the rest of their life. Apart from contending with who they are and why they do what they do, and if they ought to continue to be that way. There is also a need to evaluate how effectively they are doing what they say they want to do.</p>

<p>Blanchard and Hodges (2008) leadership in the most simple and in my estimation valuable fashion. He said that a leader is anybody who has influence on somebody else. Many people’s views of leaders is contrary to this concept. Often people think about leaders as being people in positions of authority and having managerial control over them. Last year, I put on a campus wide leadership conference in which I brought in three guest speakers to talk about leadership. The entire conference was about the underlying ethics of leadership. Chief Judge Dennis J. Sweeney J.D., L.L.M. for the Washington State Court of Appeals Division III came and spoke about leadership and public service. In preparing for the conference, I was meeting with Dennis and talking about concepts of leadership. He questioned why I had asked him to speak at the conference, and described that he did not feel much like a leader. He had a similar view of positions dictating who a leader is. Anytime that we have any influence on another person we are being a leader. Social workers have these types of leadership opportunities very often.</p>

<p>The third component of the introspective level of leadership deals with the leader acting purposefully. If it is indeed true everybody is a leader, it would seem logical we ought to be purposeful in our interactions. Blanchard and Hodges (2008) described how we can be leading others without knowing we are. He used an example of him being a father. They also described he would be influencing his children regardless if he was purposeful in his actions or not. This is true for us to, we can choose to be purposeful in our interactions or not, either way we are still leading. This also deals with self evaluation and personal growth. Covey (1989) includes what he calls sharpening the saw as one of his seven habits of an effective leader. A purposeful leader is consistently evaluating where they are, so that they know what they need to do to accomplish their goals.</p>

<h2 id="interpersonallevelofleadership">Interpersonal Level of Leadership</h2>

<p>Effective leaders also have skills that they implement. Books on leadership tend to focus on two different components of leadership. One component is the why. The other is the how. Many books talk about specific skills, especially people, evaluation, or managerial skills. These are important to factor in to leadership. They include some of the following, but are not limited to these; personal care / renewal, listening, clear communication, and micro skills. These are an important component of the interpersonal level of leadership.</p>

<p>Being a balanced leader, while being a specific skill, is larger than just implementing leadership skills. Being a balanced leader, also coincides with being a social worker. Social workers function in a variety of different roles. They have to be able to wear all the different hats that are given to them. They are expected to be able to deal with crisis’ and put out fires, but they are are also supposed to be visionary and find ways limit or put boundaries on fires. The Timothy in the Bible, in talking about preaching, that they were to be “instant in season and out of season” (2 Tim. 4:2 New American Standard Bible). While he was speaking directly about being able to preach the gospel at anytime, leaders must also be able to operate at anytime.</p>

<p>I do not believe that a top down leadership style is effective management. I believe it is a somebody who is in a leadership role’s job to find peoples skills and allow them to operate as freely as possible in those skills. It is not a leader’s job to simply dole out commends for every task and be in the job of micro management. People within an organization must be into the job of supporting the people they work with and helping them to be better equipped to handle the situations that come up in their work. This introduces the need for people development. The second year I was involved in the Master’s Commission, a leadership training discipleship school, I was an intern. I had a number of projects which where my projects. Among other tasks, I was put in charge of the distance learning curriculum and the large amount of tools we utilized for work projects. In both of these positions, I was given free rein to do what was necessary for them. This did a number of things for me and for the organization. I took ownership of those aspects, and evaluated what was important to make these components run the way I thought they needed to. It also gave me the freedom to examine how they were done and allowed me to make some improvements. Had my supervisor not given me freedom, these changes would not have been made.</p>

<h2 id="intrapersonallevelofleadership">Intrapersonal Level of Leadership</h2>

<p>One important characteristic of a leader is that of being a servant. A leaders job is not to give orders. This concept of servant leadership is really a paradigm or an outlook on life, and not only something somebody does. It is the difference between a leader thinking about the people he is leading as being there for him or is he being there for the people he is leading. This concept of servant leadership goes both up and down the chain of command. The leader should be serving those that work under him. The leader also ought to be looking out for their boss’ best interest. Evaluating what needs to be done, giving choices/opportunities to the boss, focused on helping the boss present well / move up, attempting to help them avoid pitfalls.</p>

<h2 id="areasforgrowth">Areas for Growth</h2>

<p>Formulating our personal leadership philosophy is only the first step. The second step involves the rubber meeting the road so to say. It is about taking the various philosophical concepts and applying them to our lives and judging how we meet up. This component is even a part of my leadership philosophy and being a purposeful leader.</p>

<p>The area that I need the most growth in is in personal development and people development. One concept that I believe in greatly and have practiced in the past, just not recently, is mentoring. While I do act as a mentor often for the youth that I work with, I feel it is important to have more mentorship in my life. I believe people are best improved with the following system. First they ought to be being purposefully mentored by somebody. This is somebody who will hold you accountable, who has already journeyed the road you are traveling and will help you to get further down the path (notice it’s not the end, because it’s always about moving on and not stopping once we reach a destination). Second, they ought to be mentoring others. If we expect to be mentored by somebody, it only makes sense to mentor others. Also, sometimes the greatest learning opportunities and happen as we teach and work with others.</p>

<h2 id="learningaboutleadership">Learning about leadership</h2>

<p>The process of learning about leadership has been a difficult and productive one. I remember one speaker we had come to the Master’s Commission. He was talking about ministry/service/leadership. He described the learning process being like fitting though a knot in the fence. It is often a long process of looking though the hole and seeing the end result. Knowing where we want to be, but it’s like a weight room and having to fit through the hole. He described these leaders as seeming to be really effective and shining in front of everybody, but we don’t often see what they have had to do to get there, and the hours of work they had to 
put it.</p>

<p>Leadership as a concept, especially (maybe I’m a bit biased) when taken as described above, is a very important topic to be learned. If everybody followed examined himself or herself and strove for some the qualities above, I believe the world would be a better place.</p>

My pastor one time commented that life would be a lot easier if it was not for all the people. Leadership and our interactions with other people and ideas are always interrelated.</p><p>Most people do not recognize all the leadership opportunities in their lives, or even view themselves as a leader.

Those levels are introspective, interpersonal, and Intrapersonal. The introspective deals with how we deal with ourselves and includes evaluating our own paradigms and being a purposeful leader. The major underlying paradigm is that leadership deals with influence. The interpersonal level deals with who we deal with other people. This level includes leadership/people skills, being a balanced leader, and people development. Finally the Intrapersonal level deals with people being interdependent and is really more of an outlook on life.

<p>You can read a downloadable version of this article:  <a href="/s/fasd-developing-case-prevention.pdf">Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder: <em>Developing a Case for Prevention</em></a></p>

<p>Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is an umbrella term that defines a range of effects of prenatal consumption of alcohol. This spectrum refers to such conditions as; fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), fetal alcohol effects (FAE), alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND), and alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD). Babies born with FASD cost the nation an estimated $4 billion per year. (FASD Center for Excellence Home Page, 2006) FASD is completely preventable, yet is an issue that plagues America. There is a need in America to find suitable means of prevention to FASD.</p>

<h2 id="prevalenceandscopeoffasd">Prevalence and Scope of FASD</h2>

<p>Due to the wide range of conditions that FASD incorporates, there currently is not enough statistics to give a complete and accurate range of babies that are born with FASD. Of the conditions related to FASD, FAS is the most extensively studied. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] (2006) there is a wide range of statistics showing babies being born with FAS. For every 1,000 babies born in the US, 0.2 to 1.5 have FAS. The CDC (2006) also states that cases of ARND and ARBD occur three times as often. There are approximately 4,220,000 babies that are born each year in the United States (CIA World Fact Book United States, 2006). This means that 844,000 to 6,330,000 are born with FAS. Babies born with ARND or ARBD would be estimated at 13,504,000 to 18,990,000.</p>

<p>FAS, FAE, ARND, and ARBD all have slightly different affects on the babies that are born with them. They are all similar in the fact that they have affects that are 100% preventable and last the entire lifetime of the affected child. FAE, ARND, and ARBD all are conditions that encompass parts and pieces of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. FAE is the outdated terminology for babies that have cognitive and behavior problems, but do not have all the typical diagnostic features of FAS. In 1996, the Institute of Medicine replaced the term FAE with ARND and ARBD. (CDC FASD FAQ's Page, 2006)</p>

<p>ARND refers to people with functional or mental problems (these are behavior and or cognitive deficits) linked to prenatal alcohol exposure. The behavioral deficits that occur in people with ARND can often overlap with other behavioral deficits. According to Ohio's FASD Initiative (2006), these include Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), Sensory Integration Disorder (SID), and Learning Disabilities (LD) and others. People affected by ARND can also have problems with mathematical skills, memory, attention, judgment, or a combination of these. (CDC FASD FAQ's Page, 2006)</p>

<p>Where ARND deals with psychosocial deficits, ARBD deals with biophysical birth defects resulting from prenatal alcohol use. Characteristics can be problems with heart, kidneys, bones, hearing, or a combination of these. (CDC FASD FAQ's Page, 2006) They can also include a pattern of facial anomalies. This pattern includes a smooth philtrum, thin upper lip, upturned nose, flat nasal bridge and midface, epicanthal folds, small palpebral fissures, and small head circumference. See figure #1 for a diagram of listed characteristics. (Wattendorf, D. &amp; Muenke, M., 2005)</p>

<h2 id="johnnyalookbiopsychosocialaspectsoffas">Johnny, a Look Bio-psycho-social Aspects of FAS</h2>

<p>Cramer &amp; Davidhizar (1999) look at Johnny, a 10-year-old adopted boy. While living with his adoptive parents, Johnny never had needed to be assessed for FAS. It was not until a teacher brought up concerns with the school nurse, Anne. The teacher described Johnny as "very hyperactive, distractible, attention seeking and … a variety of developmental delays." (p. 31) The teacher also described Johnny as "talkative, affectionate, and socially engaging." (p. 31) These types of behaviors are common for children with FAS. Anne took time to properly assess Johnny and his needs. She first went to Johnny's parents, and found out that Johnny had been recently adopted. The parents knew very little about Johnny's history and his birth mother. Anne enlisted the help of the parents, asking them to approach their social worker to find out more information about Johnny. It turned out that his maternal mother had a history of alcoholism, and made Johnny a likely candidate for FAS.</p>

<p>Anne started observing Johnny in the class room and playground. She also held various physical examinations. She found Johnny to have hearing problems, to be small and thin for his age. She noticed that Johnny had poor motor control and hand coordination (to such an extent that it made it nearly impossible for Johnny to grasp and manipulate his pencil to do his assignments). Johnny's also had difficulty bouncing a ball during recess. Johnny exhibited poor impulse control, often getting into fights at the playground. His family reported that Johnny had issues with "lying, difficulty [in] writing, difficulty with arithmetic, and a variety of relationship problems." (p. 31) Johnny was properly diagnosed with FAS. This case study shows the real life effects of FASD, and a few of the impacts on individuals, families, and schools.</p>

<h2 id="costoffasd">Cost of FASD</h2>

<p>FASD has a major cost on society due to the birth defects previously listed. FASD also costs our nation and government agencies financially. It is difficult to come to precise cost. Most of rigorous calculations of cost deal with FAS, verses the broader FASD. These costs are generally described in two ways; as the annual cost of FAS to the nation, and secondly as the lifetime cost of a baby born with FAS.</p>

<p>Lupton (2003) describes four different concerns in regards to estimating costs associated with FAS. First retrospective estimates tend to be higher then prospective estimates. Second is the variance in which costs should be included in the estimate. Should research, policy, administrative costs all be included in the estimate? Also, which medical conditions and costs should be associated with FAS? Third there is not account for preventive care, and the money that can be saved by effective social policies and programs. Fourth the focus is on costs to the government and does not include cost to the rest of society.</p>

<p>The range of well documented rigorous studies on cost of FAS yearly varies a great deal. Lupton (2003) says "the variation in estimated costs is huge. They range from $75 million at the low end to $4.022 billion at the high end. These results reflect the effect of very different assumptions about prevalence rates of FAS and appropriate cost components." (heading Well-Documented National Estimates, para. 10)</p>

<p>When researching the lifetime cost of FAS studies generally leave out a great number of possible items for inclusion. These items include; medical services for physical anomalies, welfare payments to family, mental health services, criminal justices, services for mild physical problems and learning disabilities, and lost productivity of care givers and persons with FASD (Lupton, 2003). Reported rigorous studies by the previously mentioned report show the lifetime costs being between 2 and 2.95 million dollars.</p>

<h2 id="hiddenstrengthsforchildrenwithfasd">Hidden Strengths for Children with FASD</h2>

<p>A holistic approach to discussing problematic dilemmas will both discuss the inadequacies and the strengths of the predicament. When Kirst-Ashman &amp; Hull (2006) describe assessments, client empowerment, and strengths; they state that "[a]ssessments that focuses solely on shortcomings of clients ignores their strengths and ability to participate fully in the change process." (p. 178) The client also has the right and an obligation to be active partners in the assessment the planned change process.</p>

<p>Having a strengths perspective can sometimes be difficult, when dealing with clients that have severe deficits. Malbin (n.d.) gives 20 different hidden strengths for children with FASD. (as cited in Manitoba Education Training and Youth, 2001) Some of these strengths are as follows: The alcohol affected children are often concrete thinkers with a strong visual memory, are good kinetic learners, interact at a high verbal level using visual language, possess strong mechanical skills, and are spontaneous and curious. (sec. 1.9)</p>

<h2 id="ecologicalperspective">Ecological Perspective</h2>

<p>Using strengths perspective means more then just looking at the client's strengths. It means taking in biological, environmental and other factors into account. Each of these factors can be labeled as systems. The ecological perspective focuses systems interaction. These systems can be at multiple levels, such as; micro-system (FASD transactions might include the bio-psycho-social factors), mezzo-system (Johnny's transactions with his school helpers [teacher and nurse] and his social worker is a good example), exo-system (In Johnny's case he is affected by the policies regarding access to information about his maternal mothers history), and macro-system (Anne had to look at the differences in federal, state and nursing criteria in diagnosing FAS).</p>

<p>All of these systems have points at which they affect the systems which they are connected. These points of connection are described as transactions. For example as previously described, the way in which Johnny's school helpers (nurse and teacher), his social worker, and his parents all have transactions in Johnny's life. Each of these transactions takes energy. This energy is either as an input (giving energy to the affected system) or an output (the affected person or system expending their energy) working towards homeostasis. These dynamic transactions cause the systems involved very often to be forced to adapt to survive.</p>

<p>Ecological perspective deals with multidimensional systems that interact with the client system. Social workers should be able to look at the multidimensional aspects of the client's life or the problem. These include; micro, mezzo, and macro. In regards to working with Johnny these can be seen at each level. For the micro level, a social worker can look at his bio-psycho-social difficulties (like his impulse control) that Johnny experiences. For the mezzo level, a social worker could categorize the different aspects school interactions (looking at the class room, playground, nurse, teacher…etc). For the macro level a social worker could look at the financial assistance that the government might help a family out who has FAS like Johnny does.</p>

<h2 id="fasdinthelightofjeanpiagettheoryofcognitivedevelopment">FASD in the Light of Jean Piaget Theory of Cognitive Development</h2>

<p>Piaget's theory of cognitive development consists of four basic stages. Dawson and Medler (n.d.) describe these four stages as the following; first is the sensory-motor period. This ranges from birth to two years old. "They learn to generalize their activities to a wider range of situations and coordinate them into increasingly lengthy chains of behavior." (para. 2) Second is preoperational thought. This stage ranges from two years old to six or seven. Children in this stage acquire representational skills (especially language) and are very self-oriented. Third is the concrete operations stage. This stage varies from six or seven to eleven or twelve. In this stage the child can move into seeing ideas from another's point of view, and ability to understand concrete (not abstract) problems. Fourth is the formal operations stage. This stage goes from eleven or twelve to adult. In this stage the child learns to think both logically and abstractly.</p>	<label>Piaget's Theory of cognitive development &amp; FASD</label>

</table><p>As previously noted, children with born with FASD often have many cognitive deficiencies. Piaget describes a common pattern of cognitive development for children. Children born with FASD do not follow Piaget's developmental stages. In each of these stages, children with FASD might not progress or show signs of the mentioned stage. See figure #2 for examples of how children born with FASD do not follow along with Piaget's Cognitive Development Stages.</p>

<p>When looking at any theory, including Piaget's, it is important to critically appraise the theory and if it is a good fit for the topic that you are looking at. Rogers (2006) gives five different questions to ask about every theory to decide if it's useful (this is from a hand out in HBSE I class by Clute, 2006). Number one, is the theory functional? For a theory to be a useful theory it must be able to clearly describe how concepts relate to each other and the phenomenon that it is trying to explain. Piaget's theory is attempting to the common developmental process that an individual goes through to get to different cognitive levels. Piaget's theory does explain how each of the different stages moves into one another and is specific in classifying the various aspects of each stage. Number two the critical thinker must ask if the theory is strong. Does the theory allow for certain predictors that can be confirmed though empirical observation. The stages that Piaget came up with have some empirical tests that can be done. According to Wikipedia (2006), there are many tests that can be preformed for the various stages. One example pertaining to the concrete operational stage, in regards to the child's elimination of egocentrism.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Show a child a comic in which Jane puts a doll under a box, leaves the room, and then Jill moves the doll to a drawer, and Jane comes back. A child in this stage will say that Jane will still think it's under the box even though the child knows it is in the drawer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The number three question that must be asked, is the theory parsimonious? A useful theory explains a lot about the phenomenon in clear and straight forward terms. Piaget often describes in clear and straightforward terms, but even this can be interpreted. Often, it can be very difficult to getting scholars to agree on common interpretations (Jean Piaget Society Resources for Students, 2006). Number four, for a theory to be useful it must be falsifiable. It must be able to be refuted by empirical testing. This concept coattails on the theory being strong. Due to the fact that the theory is strong, with certain predictors and testable aspects Piaget's theory is falsifiable. The number five question a critical thinker must ask is if the theory makes practical sense. Piaget's theory has usefulness in regards to working practically with clients. It gives helpful indicators to where a child should be cognitively as they grow up.</p>

<p>Most research that looks tat Piaget's theory of cognitive development looks at children who are more or less normal, and not a comparison to something like FASD. There are both strengths and weaknesses to looking at FASD according to Piaget's theory. Using Piaget's theory is a strength because; it alerts social workers to the need for assessing children who do not meet his stages, gives examples of way to further test and define more definitely the deficiencies in children with FASD, and shows some of the strengths of children with FASD. Using Piagets theory is a weakness because; it does not give any information about how to work with people who are dissenters to the common cognitive stages, it does not give much thought to some of the skills that people with FASD might have (such as high verbal skills [FASD Center for Excellence Education &amp; Training, 2006]), and it does not get into any of the non-cognitive deficiencies that children with FASD often have.</p>

      <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span>Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), is a continuum of birth defects related to prenatal consumption of alcohol. It is 100% preventable, yet it affects upwards of 25,320,000 babies each year (this is the top estimate, others are lower). FASD costs the United States upwards of 4 billion dollars per year. It affects children on the bio-psycho-social levels. It ranges from being completely debilitating to minor effects on the child. Children with FASD have many deficiencies, there are also many hidden strengths that can be analyzed and improved upon. FASD also is able to be looked at from a wide variety of angles, including an ecological perspective and though Piaget’s Theory of Cognitive Development.</span></p>]]></excerpt:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="breakingthecycleofaddictionaneightweekcurriculumforworkingwithadultalcoholics">Breaking the Cycle of Addiction: An Eight Week Curriculum for Working with Adult Alcoholics</h1>

<p>A downloadable version of the article can be read:  <a href="/s/breaking-cycle-addiction-curriculum-adult-alcoholics.pdf">Breaking the Cycle of Addiction: An Eight Week Curriculum for Working with Adult Alcoholics</a></p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>Breaking the Cycle of Addiction presents an eight week curriculum for working with alcoholics. The curriculum brings together experts in the various systems that the member is a part. To make the group as effective as possible it contains; accountability groups, the pharmacology of addiction, family roles, coping life and empathy skills, a victims panel, a social justice outreach to juveniles program, and a focus on life after the group.</p>

<h2 id="grouppurposeanddynamics">Group Purpose and Dynamics</h2>

<p>Breaking the Cycle of Addiction (BCA) is an organization intent on aiding alcoholics in recovery alcoholics though promoting healthy living and empowering them by providing skills and knowledge. BCA created a curriculum which effectively looks at the various systems that affect the clients. The group is facilitated by Jacob Campbell, who brings in experts for the different days activities.</p>

<p>Individuals that desire to attend BCA groups need to go though a short interview process. The interview process is to discuss the applicants expected participation in the group, cost, and confidentiality of the group. For the program to work, the participant must desire move past their alcoholism. The group itself contains 10-14 male of female participants. The group is closed asking each member to complete the entire eight weeks and disallowing new members. Each of the eight sessions last two hours, and progresses the group members in a logical order. This logical order follows the process laid out in empowerment theory.</p>

<p>Hipilito-Delgado and Lee (2007) depict empowerment theory as three separate elements that move in a sequential pattern for restoration. The first element is the individual gaining a <strong>critical consciousness</strong> in which the participant gains awareness. This consciousness affects the members gain recognition of their addiction, desire to break the addiction, and grasp the fact that they are not alone. Each of these characteristics are included in the curriculum. The members connection with other individuals with similar struggles often acts as the most powerful aspect of this. The second element is constructing a <strong>positive identity</strong>. Those with addictions often have negative self perceptions and perceptions of the world. The curriculum is designed to empower the participant to learn a new identity though training, teaching, skill building, and the discussions. The third element moves from micro and mezzo skills to macro skills by having the affiliate partake in <strong>social justice</strong>. To give the group an avenue of reaching out, they work with a group of juveniles who have been charged with a variety of alcohol related charges.</p>

<h2 id="curriculum">Curriculum</h2>

<p>Each of the week’s curricula matures from one week to the next in a logical order giving the participant the ability to effectively break their cycle of addiction. The assortment of curricula is presented by experts in the field. The curriculum is different each week, but also addresses consistent themes and activities.</p>

<p><strong>Week 1</strong>: Introduction, Goals &amp; Accountability Groups <br />
<strong>Week 2</strong>: Pharmacology of Addiction <br />
<strong>Week 3</strong>: Family Roles <br />
<strong>Week 4</strong>: Coping &amp; Life Skills <br />
<strong>Week 5</strong>: Learning to put Yourself in Others Shoes <br />
<strong>Week 6</strong>: Victims Panel <br />
<strong>Week 7</strong>: Juvenile Outreach <br />
<strong>Week 8</strong>: "Where do I go From Here?" </p>

<p>_Week one _is a time for the members to become introduced to the group, to talk about the group’s purpose, and activities. It is also an introduction into creating goals. Goals are taught using the SMART method. The first week also addresses the accountability groups that will be used every week. During every meeting the large group will break up into a small group of two or three members. During the small group discussions they will be asked about their goals, recovery issues, and keeping up with sobriety.</p>

<p><em>Week two</em>, the pharmacology of addiction is a presentation and discussion about bio-psycho-social effects of addiction. <em>Week three</em> focus’s on family roles, and the described family roles of dysfunctional families. This session’s deliberate heart is for the members to look both into their past family history, and current family situation. The self evaluative aspect of this week causes the members to see their identity in a new way. The roles that are described are; scapegoat, hero, lost child, and mascot.</p>

<p>Weeks four and five both are skill teaching days. <em>Week four</em>, coping &amp; life skills concentrates on internal thinking skills and external coping mechanisms. During week three the participants are given a reflection activity to be accomplished prior to the next weeks meeting. <a href="/s/Attachment-1.pdf">Attachment number one</a> is the reflection form used. During the session participants dialogue regarding the importance of thinking about their thinking, and skills to improve their thought life. Coping skills are presented as a tool belt. Each method used to cope with assorted aspects of the members life is described as a tool in their tool belt. These tools can be negative skills such as anger, drinking… etc. They can also be positive skills, such as talking about problems, exercise… etc. <em>Week five</em>, learning to put yourself in others shoes, teaches empathy skills.</p>

<p>Learning these empathy skills positions the participant to be prepared for <em>week six</em>. Week six brings in a victims panel to talk about individuals stories. Le (2003) in discussing victim’s panels states that research looking into the effectiveness of victims panels has been mixed. Regardless of this fact, there is a lot of evidence backing up the use of victims panels. This week also tends to be one of our heaver sessions and a longer debriefing stage.</p>

<p><em>Week seven</em> is the juvenile outreach and the social justice portion of the program. After presenting and talking with the juveniles, the group moves into the final week. <em>Week eight</em>, "Where do I go From Here?" wraps up the group. Its focus is discussing how the members can keep their sobriety after the group is finished. This will also be a time that the members of the group will have the opportunity to discuss the effectiveness and satisfaction levels of the group process.</p>

      <title>The Difficulties that the Financially Insecure have in Obtaining a Proper Burial</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="olderadultsfuneralservicesthedifficultiesthatthefinanciallyinsecurehaveinobtainingaproperburial">Older Adults Funeral Services: the Difficulties that the Financially Insecure have in Obtaining a Proper Burial</h2>

<p>You can read a downloadable version of this article:  <a href="/s/difficulties-financially-insecure-obtaining-proper-burial.pdf">Older Adults Funeral Services: the Difficulties that the Financially Insecure have in Obtaining a Proper Burial</a></p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>Death is one of the few transcendent activities that all people participate in. Even though, it is a constant, it is often a taboo subject. Along with death being a taboo subject, so is the funeral. People generally desire to obtain a proper burial. This is often a major confound when poor people are coming up on death. This is a major social problem. Symbolic interactionism is one theory that could be used to look at the over all social issue. The theory itself does not stand up as a strong theory. Empowerment theory is a practical and applicable theory that can be used to work with somebody who approaching death.</p>

<h2 id="thedesireforaproperburial">The Desire for a Proper Burial</h2>

<p>Death is most likely one of the most taboo topics in the American culture. It is a topic that is rarely brought up in normal conversation, and can be even more difficult to plan for. Within the topic of death is a great many different areas to focus on. These can include such legal topics as living will and testaments, advanced directives, and durable power of attorney. They can also encompass how family members and or spouses will deal with the death, caring for loose ends and other subjects. Added to this mountain of possible topics is the funeral service. This is often a heavy burden, especially when the person is financially insecure.</p>

<p>Planning for the funeral involves a number of different aspects. There is the aspect of financial cost. This can be a major issue if the party is poor or even lower middle class. Funerals are very expensive and although they can be covered by insurance, many Americans do not have insurance. Another aspect is the actual plan for the funeral. Moller (2004) describes that the poor often just want to be put away well, and have a proper funeral. What it means to have a proper funeral varies from person to person and culture to culture. For example, African Americans traditionally have had much more intricate and tradition based services. It is important for each person to be able to look at what a proper funeral is to them.</p>

<h2 id="olderadultsfuneralservicesandsymbolicinteractionism">Older Adults Funeral Services and Symbolic Interactionism</h2>

<p>Symbolic interactionism is a descriptive theory that social workers and other professionals often use to describe a social problem. Symbolic interactionism focuses one the symbols that people create. Straker (2002) describes the key aspects as; meanings of interactions, interpretations of symbols by others, the effect of others interpretations, social structures. Funerals services are often very symbolic. Although the symbolisms vary from funeral to funeral, they often are meant to do some of the following. Symbolically say good bye, give a memorial that symbolizes the dead, and celebrate the dead symbolic awakening into the afterlife.</p>

<p>To use symbolic interactionism one would focus a lot on the various symbols. There are symbols both in the funeral itself and in the social problem of poor people not being able to afford the funeral. A symbolic interactionist would talk about the feelings associated with not being able to afford a funeral. Then how others viewing the poor’s lack of ability to finance a funeral are and what symbols they are made of. Then they would even compare that with how those outside thoughts can affect the poor even more.</p>

<p>Rogers (2006) describes five criteria for judging theories, they must; be functional, strong, parsimonious, falsifiable, and make practical sense. Firstly, symbolic interaction does not have clarity or ridged specifics integrated in its use. It is often elusive and based on opinion what is symbolic and then what that symbol means. It also is not functional in bringing about social change. Secondly, symbolic interactionism is not strong, because it does not allow for predictions to be made about future behavior. Thirdly, symbolic interactionism does not become easily incorporated with other theories or perspectives. Fourthly, symbolic interactionism is not falsifiable. The concepts involved to not allow for empirical observations. Fifthly, most of the time it does not make practical sense for the social worker to attempt to help client. Symbolic interactionism is a weak theory that does not have much use except to bring understanding to the client about the importance of symbols.</p>

<h2 id="olderadultsfuneralservicesandempowermenttheory">Older Adults Funeral Services and Empowerment Theory</h2>

<p>Aria (1997) describes five stages of empowerment theory. The first two stages focus on the client and problem interaction. She defines them as experiencing powerlessness and coming to awareness. The third stage is where the social worker client interaction is the focus; she titles it connecting and learning. The forth and fifth stages are where the client takes their new skills and reaches out with them. She labels them as mobilization / action and contribution.</p>

<p>Empowerment theory could be used to both to work with clients who are preparing to die and need a funeral service and also with clients with family members who recently had a funeral service. In working with a client who is preparing to die, they must realize that they are dying and financially insecure and that they are not the only ones in a similar predicament. This must include a desire to do as much as possible before their time is up. Empowerment theory often deals with teaching skills. In this case, it could be working on planning skills (for the actual funeral) or working through bureaucracies to help obtain funding for the funeral. Connecting the client with a dying support group could be helpful. The client also may be willing to help advocate for more health care coverage or cheaper avenues for obtaining a funeral.</p>

<p>Empowerment theory is a productive theory for working with clients; it does still have some limitations. Especially in dealing with funerals and death, traditionally very spiritual events, the theory does not go in-depth. It overlooks the biology of the clients, often a major concern for those dying. It is also difficult to operationalize and measure.</p>

      <title>Ethics in Research</title>
      <link>/resources/ethics-research</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As with every other area of social work, ethics is an important discussion.The NASW has a specific document completely focused on ethics (<a href="http://www.naswdc.org/pubs/code/default.asp" title="NASW Code of Ethics">NASW Code of Ethics</a>).Research requires specific ethical considerations. Sensitivity in conducting research is among those important considerations.The following lists some important areas to consider;</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Voluntary Participation</strong>: Giving a small stipend is acceptable to the research participant, but giving to large of amount of money can change the outcomes of the study.</li>
<li><strong>Informed Consent</strong>: Participants must be told about the risks &amp; benefits of the study.This is normally done though having participants sign a legal document.</li>
<li><strong>Do No Harm</strong>: The study needs to not harm participants physically or emotionally.Studies such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_syphilis_experiment">Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment</a> is often cited for an example of do no harm.</li>
<li><strong>Deception</strong>: Deceiving participants in any way (even if it does not harm them) is considered unethical.This could even include being deceptive about who you are or what you are doing.</li>
<li><strong>Analysis &amp; Reporting</strong>:All results must be published and done in an unbiased way.</li>
<li><strong>Sensitivity to Diversity</strong>: The researchers must take notice of various areas regarding diversity.</li>
</ol>

<p>Researchers must also look at the types of promises that they give to their participants, so that they can follow though with them.</p>

<p>Two terms that are easy to confuse are anonymity and confidentiality. These terms are defined as... <br />
<strong>Anonymity</strong>: Research cannot match individuals with their responses ("I don't know who you are") <br />
<strong>Confidentiality</strong>: Researcher promises not to reveal individual data ("I won't tell who you are")</p>

<p>Qualitative research has the same ethical issues BUT in it the researcher is more likely to interact with the participant and have a closer ongoing relationship.Furthermore the research is often more flexible and fluid in it's implementation.The research must be careful of not having any role conflicts (i.e. the researcher is also the participants therapist.Due to the highly personal nature of qualitative research, Sometimes qualitative studies have a "blurring" of roles.When it is possible, it is best to not have the researcher have these role conflicts.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Overview of The Research Process</title>
      <link>/resources/overview-research-process</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="thescientificmethod">The Scientific Method</h2>

<p>Researching should follow the scientific method. Research is a scientific endeavor that has direct practice implications. Due to this the scientific model ought to be utilized. The process of describing the variables and aspects of a study is known as overcapitalization. The first phase is looking at problem formulation. There are some concerns to look at in regards to the area of study.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The So What Factor</strong>: The study must have clear significance for social work in order for study to have merit</li>
<li><strong>Feasibility</strong>: Is the study possible? Is it a practical? The researcher must factor in the time, cost, potential participant cooperation, etc of the study.</li>
<li><strong>Ethical Constraints</strong>: The researcher must look into the <a href="/resources/ethics-research">ethical considerations</a> in doing the research (the benefits must out weight the risks).</li>
<li><strong>Relevant</strong>: The research should come from problems within social service agencies or practical problems regarding social welfare in general.</li>
<li><strong>Applied Approach</strong>: The study needs to have a link to social work concerns (it's not just collecting data for the fun of it).</li>
<li><strong>Implementation</strong>: The results are to be used to guide practice and or policy</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="researchprocess">Research Process</h2>

<p>The process of research is as follows; <br />
<strong>Phase 1: Problem Formulation</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>A question is posed and is progressively refined to become more meaningful and feasible</li>
<li>The unit of analysis (e.g. level or system size), hypotheses, research questions, and being operationally defined (working definition - "counting" the variables) are all concepts that are explained during phase 1.</li>
<li>Furthermore a literature review is to be conducted regarding previous related studies. The researcher ought to ask what did they find and look into the weaknesses of these studies.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Phase 2: Study Design</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Decisions are to be made about planning the study.</li>
<li>Study procedures are to be created (e.g. sampling, measurement tools, analysis of the results.</li>
<li>The <a href="/resources/types-study-designs">type of study design</a> should be formulated.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Phase 3: Data Collection</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Implementation of the study design <br />
Remember: differences between qualitative (flexible) and quantitative (rigid)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Phase 4: Data Processing</strong></p>

<p><strong>Phase 5: Data Analysis</strong></p>

<p><strong>Phase 6: Interpreting Findings</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Discussion of findings</li>
<li>Exploring alternate explanations</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Phase 7: Writing the Research Report</strong> (Must be APA Style)</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The Ethnicity of Non-Ethnicity</title>
      <link>/resources/articles/ethnicity-non-ethnicity</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="theethnicityofnonethnicitytheethnicautobiographyofthedominateculture">The Ethnicity of Non-Ethnicity: The Ethnic Autobiography of the Dominate Culture</h2>

<p>You can read the downloadable version of this article:  <a href="/s/ethnicity-non-ethnicity.pdf">The Ethnicity of Non-Ethnicity: The Ethnic Autobiography of the Dominate Culture</a></p>

<h2 id="ethnicitytheunnoticedtrait">Ethnicity, the Unnoticed Trait</h2>

<p>As a white protestant male, I am a member of the dominate culture in the United State. Growing up I never had to question if somebody was doing certain actions because of my ethnicity. I never had any difficulty finding people who looked like me, and being able to be accepted into a group. I never really thought about my skin color or my racial background. My mom never had to explain about my Germanic heritage, or did I ever wonder about cultural practices. All of these where vary far removed from my growing up experiences growing up.</p>

<p>Going thought the school of social work, there is often discussion about diversity and cultural competence (sensitivity). These topics are relatively new to my knowledge base. Growing up, I did have many Latino and black friends, but never thought much about it. Due to being a part of the dominant culture, my culture did not seem that important to me. When we were sitting in class an hearing some people of color saying that dislike it when people say that they are color blind or when people say they don't care about their ethnicity I thought that they were just taking the comments wrong. It wasn't until later when I thought about it, that I realized that it was their ethnicity had become a major portion of their life. This was also one of the first time that I really realized that I did not see my ethnicity as a major determining factor in my life.</p>

<p>All of this could be explained in an analogy. In America, having running water is something that pretty much everybody has access to. It would be very un-common for an American to even question having the running water, they have always had it. I went on a mission trip to Africa, and there where places that the people had to go to great lengths to obtain water. The places that did have running water, it was brown and smelled bad. They knew the importance of working to obtain water that is necessary for life. I have always had my white skin and never thought about it. For some they have had to deal with discrimination and overt / covert forms of oppression because of their skin color. With this, they have realized the importance of their ethnicity.</p>

<h2 id="oppressionovertcovert">Oppression – Overt &amp; Covert</h2>

<p>In the past I also used to mostly only think about racial oppression as something happened more in the past. I knew there were some groups that still practiced overt oppression, but I thought those experiences where far and few in-between. Shen (2003) describes the effects of this oppression as;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Injustice is pervasive in our society. The sociopolitical framework that compartmentalizes difference creates identity groups that are targeted with oppression and identity groups that are the agents of that oppression, e.g., People of Color and White people. Injustice is then maintained by the unequal power dynamics that result. The agents of oppression appear to benefit from this system, and the targets of the oppression suffer noticeably. All people are affected by these power dynamics dictated by difference. (p. 65)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These pieces of oppression have to deal with both the overt and the covert forms of oppression. The covert aspects of oppression are by definition more difficult to notice. Before coming face to face with various stories about covert oppression, I did not know it existed nor had a real impact on people's life. During the African American panel in my Diversity class, George talked about going to different stores and always having the store employees follow him around every where he went (personal communication, April 16, 2007).</p>

<h2 id="roadmaptothefuture">Roadmap to the Future</h2>

<p>The human experience is very personal and individual. None of us can fully understand what it is like to be another person or fully realize the impact that various events have on that person's life. That is what empathy is for, that we should attempt to understand where that individual is coming from. We can modify our own behavior and try to act in culturally sensitive ways. We can work on removing biases and overt 7&amp; covert forms of oppression from our lives.</p>

<p>The funny thing about the ethnicity of non-ethnicity is that, with-out recognizing it my ethnicity has been very important in my life. I am thankful for having learned how much I've taken my own ethnicity for granted.</p>

      <title>Critical Article Review: Supervisors and Stress</title>
      <link>/resources/articles/article-review-supervisors-and-stress</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="criticalarticlereviewsupervisorsandstress">Critical Article Review: Supervisors and Stress</h1>

<p>You can read a downloadable version of the article:  <a href="/s/critical-article-review-example-supervisors-stress.pdf">Critical Article Review: Supervisors and Stress</a></p>

<h2 id="operationaldescriptionofarticle">Operational Description of Article:</h2>

<p>Regehr et al. (2002) formulated a study to examine managers / supervisor responses to various stressors involved in working for a child welfare agency. Their research addresses the following questions;</p>

<ol>
<li>What is the nature of the stressors experienced by supervisors and managers following a process of child welfare reform?</li>
<li>What is the impact of the stressors on managers and supervisor?</li>
<li>How do the stresses encountered by managers and supervisors compare with those of front line workers?</li>
</ol>

<p>Out of these questions the researchers hypothesis that the stress level for managers / supervisors is higher then those labeled as front line workers. They also hypothesis managers / supervisors rates of giving up instead of resilience are greater then in recorded history.</p>

<p>The study goes into a fairly in-depth lit review in regards to previous studies on managers / supervisors stressors and affects. The study itself uses a probability sampling method in which every member of Children's Aid Society of Toronto is given a questionnaire, with approximately 33% response rate. This is the quantitative aspect of the research project. The questionnaire included several measures of "exposure to traumatic events, levels of social support, and levels of distress" (p. 22). The researchers also, engaged in a non-probability sampling via quota for the qualitative facet of the project. They chose eight members the managers / supervisors and eight members of the front line workers to participate in open ended interviews. The interviews included "questions about stressors encountered on the job, the effects of the stress on participants, organizational supports and strategies for dealing with stress" (p. 23).</p>

<p>The methods of investigating the specific research questions with the canvasser's hypothesis in mind seems appropriate. The research gave opportunity to the entire population that the researchers were attempting to look at. The sample size of respondents is large enough to be generalized to much of the organization. The canvasser's state that "it is important to underscore that this is not intended to be reflective of all mangers and supervisors in all child welfare organizations" (p. 33). The amount of respondents selected for interview is an acceptable amount for qualitative research. The questions gave a greater context to the needs of the agency, and specific ways in which the individuals coped with the stressors.</p>

<p>The report's quantitative component has well established measurement apparatuses. This leads to a stronger internal validity. Internal validity deals with if the relationship to the cause and affect are causal. In the report, do the stated stressors cause higher stress levels for the managers / supervisors? It seems in that the corollary aspects are fairly strong in describing these affects. The quantitative data being paired with the qualitative data seems to further prove the causal relationship of stressors to stress. Some of the threats to internal validity are as follows; history, maturation, testing, instrumentation changes, statistical regression, selection biases, ambiguity about the direction of causal influence.</p>

<p>The article looks at the history of the stressor and stress relationship. This seems to be consistent. The survey measures a specific point in time and the responder's attitudes, which could be a possible confound. The tests implemented are established and respected. These tests are not described as changing throughout the research process. The statistics do not show a regression. Each of the points that respondents are chosen, it is by random selection. It seems natural that the stressors cause the stress, and not ambiguous.</p>

<p>The discourse shows both the dependent and independent variables. The independent variables are the stresses that are described by the clients. The dependent variables are the stressors that the respondents describe as affecting the stresses. For the qualitative aspect of the research, they seem to be reliable and valid. The questions that are used point to specific answers about the dependent variables, making them valid. They are asked to all of the used respondents making them reliable.</p>

<p>The authors of the study are specific, as mentioned previously, to how generalizable this study is. They state that it is generalizable to the members of the given agency. Some of the reasons that they state that it is not generalizable is because of some of the specific circumstances of the agency. They describe the agency as a "large organization in a major city that has been subject to two high profile coroner's inquests" (p. 33). The sample size and number of respondents supports greater genralizability.</p>

<h2 id="discussiononarticlesconclusions">Discussion on Articles Conclusions</h2>

<p>The article is well put together. The authors support their conclusions with the data at multiple levels. As with any study, there are weakness and limitations. One weakness that is not described in the discourse has to do with funding. The very agency that is being examined is reported to have generously supported the research. Of the named researchers, one is the assistant director and the other is the organizations coordinator of research, which is another confound. This study seems to be a little too close to home for comfort and would have been helpful to have an outside third-party evaluation. The research method was also not anonymous and, although not stated, it is possible that the respondents felt forced into participating.</p>

<p>The research material seems to be needed for practice. Although, the material does not deal with a specific population for social workers to have be engaging in some sort of client interaction. The implications of the stress levels for works in child welfare, and lays the foundation for further research looking into how to reduce the various aspects.</p>

<p>You can read the downloadable version of this article.  <a href="/s/2012-coalition-assessment-report-summary.pdf">2012 Coalition Assessment Report Summary: An Overview of the Annual Coalition Summary</a>.</p>

<h3 id="coalitionassessmenttoolreportoverview">Coalition Assessment Tool Report Overview</h3>

<p>Colin Powell (n.d.) is cited as stating, "Bad news isn't wine. It doesn't improve with age." This is a very true statement. No matter how old you get, it never seems that negative feedback never seems to get easier to stomach. While this may be true, it is also true when we learn our strengths and our weaknesses, we can get better and that should be good news for all of us. The 2012 coalition assessment survey that was collected for the Pasco Discovery Coalition (PDC) and other coalitions statewide seems to show a negative outlook for the organization, but it can also be viewed as a wakeup call to what needs to be improved. Generally and rudimental the results of the 2012 Annual Coalition Survey are reported.</p>

<p>The Pasco Discovery Coalition is a group of community leaders who gather from different sectors with the vision of "working to promote stronger youth and safer neighborhoods by combating gangs / violence, alcohol and other drugs, and teen pregnancy" in Pasco Washington. They are funded through the Department of Social and Human Services <a href="http://www.dshs.wa.gov/DBHR/">Department of Behavioral Health and Recovery (DBHR)</a> in Washington State through their Prevention Redesign Initiative (PRI).</p>

<p>The Prevention Redesign Initiative requires all coalitions to under their supervision and funding to complete a pretest posttest survey to assess various characteristics of what makes up a productive and successful. This data is compared to the previous years survey (if there is one, as is the case for the PDC) along with being compared to other coalitions in the state. The survey referenced in this report is the PDC's second set of surveys and acts as the pretest for the coalition and is compared to the pretest survey results from 2011.</p>

<p>The survey requests the coalition participates feelings regarding various components of being a coalition through a likert scale of one to five along with a possible answer of Don't Know or Not Applicable. The scale is listed using the following vocabulary: Strongly Disagree, Disagree, Neither Agree or Disagree, Agree, and Strongly Agree. The questions address the following areas related to the coalition characteristics:</p>

<ul>
<li>Vision, mission, and goals</li>
<li>Coalition structure and membership</li>
<li>Coalition leadership – Our coalition coordinator / director</li>
<li>Outreach and communication</li>
<li>Coalition meetings and communications</li>
<li>Opportunities for member growth and responsibility</li>
<li>Effectiveness in planning and implementation</li>
<li>Relationships with local government and other community members</li>
<li>Relationship with other organizations</li>
<li>Coalitions members' sense of ownership and participation</li>
<li>Ability to collect, analyze, and use data</li>
<li>Understanding of and commitment to environmental change strategies</li>
<li>Cultural competence</li>
<li>Funding and sustainability</li>
<li>Background information</li>
</ul>

<p>A copy of the Coalition Assessment Tool can be found as <a href="/s/pdc-coalition-assessment-tool-quvb.pdf">Appendices A</a>. The survey was completed via a web-based form, where a request was sent to coalition participants listed as active with DBHR. The participants were emailed by the coalition chairperson, Jacob Campbell, with an individualized password to be permitted to access their survey on a specified website. They were also given a PDF version of the survey that they could complete if desired and turn into the PRI Coordinator, Teresa Bell, although none of the participants choose to complete the survey in this fashion.</p>

<p>During the 2011 survey, the PDC turned in nine surveys out of 190 surveys turned in by 16 statewide coalitions. During this, most recent survey, the PDC turned in 10 surveys out of 233 surveys from 22 state coalitions. The members chosen for the survey were based on coalition members listed as active on the DBHR website which tracks coalition attendance and participation. The survey request was sent to 16 different coalition members and then a follow email was sent again to make a second request for completion of the survey.</p>

<h3 id="overviewoftheresults">Overview of the Results</h3>

<p>The Coalition Assessment Tool Report created by DBHR Performance Based Prevention System can be found as <a href="/s/pdc-coalition-assessment-tool-report.pdf">Appendices B</a> and delineates the results both historical and comparative. The comparative results show results from the state high and low compared to the PDC. The numbers are calculated using the an average taken to the second decimal place of the coalition participants answers related to the likert scale (i.e. the closer to 5 the more the members agreed and the closer to 1 the less they agreed).</p>

<p>Regarding the 2011 report, the state scored the three lowest scores with the follow categories coalition structure and membership, outreach and communication, and effectiveness in planning and implementation with scores of 3.13, 3.13, and 3.43 respectively. The states three highest scores included partnerships with other organizations, cultural competence, and ability to collect, analyze, and use data with scores of 5.00, 4.91, and 4.75 respectively.</p>

<p>The PDC's 2011 results showed the three lowest scores as funding and sustainability, opportunities for member growth and responsibility, and relationships with local government and other community leaders with scores respectively being 3.63, 3.79, and 3.97. Their three highest scores were in the categories of cultural competence, vision, mission and goals, partnerships with other organizations with the following scores respectively 4.50, 4.39, and 4.30.</p>

<p>The state in 2012 continued to have outreach and communication, and coalition structure and members as two of the three lowest scores, but with lower numbers respectively 2.77 and 2.91. Furthermore funding and sustainability were responses were lower with an average score of 2.88. The three highest scores was actually a tie with between four categories: outreach and communication, relationship with local government and other community leaders, partnerships with other organizations, ability to collect, analyze, and use data, and understanding of and commitment to environmental change strategies with top scores of 5.00.</p>

<p>For the PDC the three lowest scores on the 2012 survey were outreach and communication, funding and sustainability, coalition structure and membership with respective scores of 2.85, 2.88, and 2.91. The highest scores were cultural competence, coalition meetings and communications, and partnerships with other organizations with respective scores of 3.91, 3.68, and 3.56.</p>

<h3 id="generaldiscussionregardingresults">General Discussion Regarding Results</h3>

<p>There are some limitations to the data collected in this survey. The number of survey responses is generally a small number, both statewide and locally, to be considered highly generalizable and correlative. The data provided only shows averages of the various coalitions surveyed. The very limited amount of local participants for the PDC (n=10) permits the data to be skewed 10% overall for each participations responses.</p>

<p>The limitation of the study aside, the data is positive for getting an overview of some of the feelings of coalition participants and to be evaluated to look forward as to what are some of the ways that the PDC can improve their practices and form a more successful coalition affecting the change desired.</p>

<p>Looking generally over the data, it is apparent that the participants of this study scored the PDC categorically lower then they did during the previous 2011 survey. None of the general coalition characteristics showed an improvement in the views of the coalition participants. There were only a couple of quests that showed improvement in results from the previous years responses. The PDC also showed up at the lowest end of six of the coalition general characteristics and was within less then .1 of two other responses landing us at the same rate as the state low (it is not clear whether other coalitions had the same low number, but we were at least equal to or lower then all of the coalition in those areas). It is also clear that in the dataset given for the 2012 survey, the spread of high to low is much wider then the previous 2011 survey (i.e. scores with a higher standard deviation). Furthermore, the data only showcases the PDC and the lowest and the highest coalition scores. It does not give an accurate picture of where all of the other coalitions are or any type of median scores state wide, only the extremes.</p>

<p>The benefit of this data is that it gives the PDC a number of areas to focus on and improve to increase our overall effectiveness. Of the three areas receiving the lowest scores the lowest is funding and sustainability. The two most concerning topics within this general topic for coalition members appeared to be having multiple funding sources for the coalition and writing grants. Both of which are areas for capacity building within the PDC.</p>

<p>Another area of capacity building that the coalition needs to improve upon is the outreach and communication. This includes areas such as including the community in general involved in the business of the coalition, working with media (i.e. getting the coalition name out there), and engaging with you.</p>

<p>The third lowest scoring area of the 2012 survey responses rate also seems to showcase the need for capacity building. This respondents described not having all of the necessary sectors being represented, having the right number of members, and having well defined roles.</p>

<p>As a coalition, this information should be evaluated and a discussion about a couple of areas of focus should be decided as to how to improve some of the general characteristics of the PDC.</p>

      <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Colin Powell (n.d.) is cited as stating, "Bad news isn’t wine. It doesn’t improve with age." This is a very true statement. No matter how old you get, it never seems that negative feedback never seems to get easier to stomach. While this may be true, it is also true when we learn our strengths and our weaknesses, we can get better and that should be good news for all of us. The 2012 coalition assessment survey that was collected for the Pasco Discovery Coalition (PDC) and other coalitions statewide seems to show a negative outlook for the organization, but it can also be viewed as a wakeup call to what needs to be improved. Generally and rudimental the results of the 2012 Annual Coalition Survey are reported.</p>]]></excerpt:encoded>

      <title>Study of a Diverse Population</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="studyofadiversepopulationprisonerstheleftoutgroup">Study of a Diverse Population: Prisoners the Left out Group</h2>

<p>You can read a downloadable copy of this article. <a href="/s/diverse-populations-prisoners.pdf">Study of a Diverse Population: Prisoners the Left out Group</a></p>

<h3 id="culturalbackgroundtraditionnormsandvalues">Cultural Background, Tradition, Norms and Values</h3>

<p>Populations or groups are often broken up into subgroups. Prisoner's are a subgroup that is not often looked at, when looking at diverse populations. There are many stigmas that are on prisoners and other reasons that they are tended to be left out. Benaquisto and Peter (1996) studied the culture of prisoners to see if they as a subgroup have significant cultural differences from the overall population. Although there are many differences, much of the culture can be related to the population at large.</p>

<p>Studying a diverse population helps the social worker to know better practices for working with members in that population. It must be stated that these cultural generalizations do no carry over to every member of that population, and each individual that a social worker has as a client needs to be treated as an individual. Although there are many aspects of a population that must be addressed the culture acts as a sort of foundation to the population. This foundation consists of cultural backgrounds, traditions, norms, and values.</p>

<p>Culture consists of characteristics that are passed on from generation to generation by learning alone (Wikipedia, 2007). The cultural background deals with various aspects of the culture that has brought the group to be where they are. For prisoners this is a very diverse topic and one that could be approached in a variety of ways. One approach to this is looking at the demographics of prisoners. There is an estimated 5.6 million adults who had ever served time in State or Federal prison. An estimated 64% of prison inmates belong to racial or ethnic group. In our local jails, 31% grew up with a parent or guardian who abused alcohol or drugs, about 12% had lived in a foster home or institution, 46% had a family member who had been incarcerated (United States, 2006).</p>

<p>Traditions or norms are a part of culture that are passed from generation to generation. Some common traditions and norms for prisoners are gang involvement and violence. Walker (2007) describes inmates joining gangs as “as a means to protect themselves from other groups and inmate predators” (¶ 1). Another tradition that is often associated with prisoners is violence and rape. Stop Prison Rape (2006) cites a study that looked at four Midwestern prisons that approximately one in five male inmates reported a pressured or forced sex incident while incarcerated. About one in ten male inmates reported that that they had been raped.</p>

<p>The values that prisoners hold can be very different from those of mainstream society. Honesty, treatment of others, intelligence, and attitude are arguably highly respected concepts to society over all. Winfree, Newbold and Tubb (2002) show that prisoners respectively only placed value on these concepts in the following numbers; Honesty 33.8%, treatment of others 23.1%, intelligence 10.8%, and attitude 12.3% with 10.8% reserving comment. In summing up various open ended questions, they stated that the following were common values held by the prisoners;</p>

<blockquote>'Don't interfere with inmate interests'; 'Play it cool and do your own time'; 'Don't break your word'; 'Don't steal from the cons'; 'Don't welsh on debts'; 'Don't weaken'; and 'Be sharp'<br />
<p style="text-align: right;">(pg. 229)</p></blockquote>

<p>Prisoners partake in a culture that is all their own. To gain a better understanding of them and how to work with them social workers need to look into this culture. An in-depth survey into their culture utilizes; cultural background, traditions, norms, and values.</p>

      <title>Quality Assurance Survey for Safe Harbor Crisis Nursery</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="qualityassurancesurveyforsafeharborcrisisnursery">Quality Assurance Survey for Safe Harbor Crisis Nursery</h2>

<p>You can read the downloadable version of this article:  <a href="/s/safe-harbor-crisis-nursery-article.pdf">Quality Assurance Survey for Safe Harbor Crisis Nursery</a></p>

<h2 id="safeharborcrisisnursery">Safe Harbor Crisis Nursery</h2>

<p><em>because every child deserves a safe harbor…</em></p>

<h3 id="whoissafeharbor">Who Is Safe Harbor?</h3>

<p>Safe Harbor Crisis Nursery (SHCN) serves the community's most needy parents and their children. Safe Harbor provides a safe and friendly care for local families who are unable to find support in a time of crisis. SHCN provides its services free of charge in order to give all parents the opportunity to place their children in the care of our trusted staff and volunteers</p>

<h3 id="whoisservedbysafeharborcrisisnursery">Who Is Served By Safe Harbor Crisis Nursery?</h3>

<p>The Crisis Nursery serves a broad range of families with diverse family structures. Approximately two thirds of the families served are headed by single parents . Seventy five percent of the clients classify themselves as white. Of the non-white clientele, 60% are Latino. The majority of families served are economically disadvantaged. Nearly 75% of our clients earn less than $16,000. Many of the clients receive some sort of public assistance. A recent survey of the clientele found that 80% relied on the State Department of Social and Health Services, and 60% depend upon the federal WIC program for nutritional support. In addition to these governmental programs, nearly half of the clients are receiving some form of counseling and/or treatment through programs such as Safe Babies Safe Mom's and Lourdes Counseling Services.</p>

<h3 id="whatarethereasonsthatourservicesareused">What Are The Reasons That Our Services Are Used?</h3>
  
       [caption id="" align="alignnone" width="1000.0"]<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51dcde94e4b09506a9c98fbc/525af6cbe4b077ec7f4a4a44/525b66b0e4b0107b330ab036/1381721778638/safe-harbor-quality-assurance-rticle-pie-chart.png" alt=" A pie chart displaying the services used by their clients in 2005 for the Quality Assurance Survey for Safe Harbor Crisis Nursery "/>  A pie chart displaying the services used by their clients in 2005 for the Quality Assurance Survey for Safe Harbor Crisis Nursery [/caption] 
  

<p>The needs for the services provided by SHCN are as diverse as the clientele. As the chart on the right demonstrates, nearly one third of all the clients use our services for emergency childcare. The preliminary results for our 2004 Quality Assurance Survey, shows the inability of SHCN's clients to find "safe and reliable child care in an emergency" without Safe Harbor. This affirms the necessity of our services to the community. I have no other option and they never turn me away.</p>

<p>The second most important reason for use of the services we provide is to allow parents to go to work. This critical service enables the clients to move towards self-sufficiency while ensuring adequate care of their children. In addition, SCHN offers care for children whose parents need vital mental health treatment or intervention. Without this service, a crucial component enabling clients' transition to stability and independence in their lives would be lost. Safe Babies Safe Mom's, a program of the Benton-Franklin Health District, partners with SHCN to provide their clientele childcare while they participate in that program's support groups.</p>

<h3 id="whatkindofdifferencedowemakeinourclientslives">What Kind Of Difference Do We Make in Our Clients Lives?</h3>

<p>The preliminary results for our 2004 Quality Assurance Survey have shown that our clients are very satisfied with our services. All of the respondents felt strongly that SHCN treated them with respect and provided exceptional care for their children.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Safe Harbor Crisis Nursery has been there for my girls and me. I feel that my girls have been well taken care of.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our clients were satisfied with SHCN hours of availability and all felt that they received the support that they needed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Safe Harbor Crisis Nursery's most valuable service has been their care and help with my child.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Safe Harbor Crisis Nursery betters the lives that it touches. There are still more lives to be touched and Safe Harbor's goal is to serve these new families.</p>

<h2 id="documentsusedanddescription">Documents Used and Description</h2>

<p>Each of the clients were sent out the following information in English and Spanish;</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/s/safe-harbor-crisis-nursery-article-coverletter.pdf">Cover letter</a> (<a href="/s/safe-harbor-crisis-nursery-article-coverletter-es.pdf">en español</a>) describing method of completion and purpose</li>

<li>The <a href="/s/safe-harbor-crisis-nursery-survey.pdf">survey</a> (<a href="/s/safe-harbor-crisis-nursery-article-survey-es.pdf">en español</a>) used for clients to fill out their impressions of SHCN.</li>
<li>All of this was sent with an inclosed addressed and stamped envelope to encourage response</li>
</ul>

<p>Of the 31 clients that were sent out information, only 11 sent back responses. For each of them that sent back information, the data was compiled into an excel document. To help keep the survey information clear, a <a href="/s/safe-harbor-crisis-nursery-numbered-questions.pdf">blank survey</a> was created using numbers for each of the questions. The <a href="/s/safe-harbor-crisis-nursery-article-data.xlsx">data was compiled</a> (<a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=poghYDtSTQ7SLHEIOX_9UGQ&amp;output=html">Google Documents</a>) and the above report was written.

      <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A quality assurance survey looking into&nbsp;<a href="http://crisis-nursery.org/">Safe Harbor Crisis Nursery</a>. The project proposal goes as follows;</p><p>Jacob Campbell in conjunction with Reid Helford (professor at Columbia Basin College), Sue Delucchi (Executive Director for SHCN), Antonio Cruz (professor at Columbia Basin College) for help with translation put together the 2005 quality assurance survey. They sent out a survey to the most frequent participants of SHCN to assess their services. This survey will have several components and factors to help it along. First, the survey took the 31 clients who used SHCN is services most frequently during the 2005 year. Second each of these clients were mailed the following items both in English and Spanish;</p><ol><li>Cover letter describing method of completion and purpose</li><li>Ticket for baby diapers as an incentive</li><li>The survey</li></ol><p>The returned surveys were compiled onto an excel chart, and the client names were replaced with a code for confidentiality.

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and similarly lead groups make up a vast amount of groups in both America and around the world. They are led in a laissez fair manner and are often open groups where anybody is allowed to attend. First the functioning of groups is looked at though the lens of an individual case study of an AA group meeting. This functioning of groups has three things that are looked into; (1) evidence based practice, (2) group dynamics and (3) group composition. Then the process of an AA group meeting is also discussed. Finally a personal reaction to the AA group meeting and facilitation type is addressed.</p>

<h2 id="aagroupdynamicsandcomposition">AA Group Dynamics and Composition</h2>

<p>Group work is a very important topic for social workers. The majority of social workers will lead or be a part of a least some sort of a group during their career. While it is important for a worker to know how to lead a group, it is also vital that they know how to evaluate a group and systematically look at the various aspects of groups. To look at how this can be done a simple case study of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) will be used. It must be noted although AA has specific guidelines to how meetings are ran, they are not ran by paid professionals and the facilitation various across the network.</p>

<p>The aspects that the worker should be able to examine at systematically can be divided into three categories; evidence based practice, group dynamics, and composition. Evidence based practice deals with looking into the theoretical foundations of the group and the research that has been done on the group. Helliker (2006) describes AA as the following;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is hardly scandalous that A.A. hasn't undergone the most rigorous of scientific testing. Evidence-based medicine is designed to root out false marketing claims and unnecessary costs. A.A. makes no marketing claims and charges no fees. Instead of being handed scientific literature, newcomers to A.A. hear existing members tell how they used the program to get sober. Evidence-based medicine is also designed to compare treatments.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is this same format that allows them to be run non-professionally. Smart and Mann (2000) say that it is the member’s testimony that is a key factor in the acceptance of various self help strategies. What ever the case, there is evidence showing groups such as AA can be effective, but it does not work for everybody. Looking at the evidence based practice of groups is just the first step in assessing their effectiveness.</p>

<p>Group dynamics deals with structure of the group. For example, there are both AA groups that are open and ones that are closed. An open group is one that anybody is allowed to attend, and group membership is not required. Due to ethical considerations, the AA group meeting that was studied was an open group. At the session there was 12 attendees (not counting myself and my fellow social work student). The members seemed to be familiar with each other, greeting each other by first names and making assuming comments about group attendance ("oh… there is Jesse"). Many of the members during there sharing time talked about their group attendance. One of the members mentioned they were attending four or five groups a week, but was not as active now.</p>

<p>Closely associated with dynamics is the composition of a group. Group composition deals with the types of members that are attending. Although the group was an open group, all the attendees are alcoholics (other then the outside observers). This was shown again when each member would have their time to talk. The dialog would go something similar to as follows;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sharing member: "Hi, my name is Bob and I’m an alcoholic."</p>
  
  <p>Group: "Hi Bob."</p>
  
  <p>Sharing member: "Well, I can really relate to both topics…"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Composition also deals with the demographics of the members. For example, it can be valuable to look at the sex of the members. During the attended session there was only one female group attendee. For some groups there is a screening process. For open AA, there is none of this. Before the group started, a sheet of paper was passed around and members who desired to speak were asked to write their name down and if they had any specific topics they wished to be discussed. Age is another consideration of composition that should be explored. All of the group members seemed to be late middle aged (40 and up). There were two members that talked about being more or less retired.</p>

<h2 id="groupprocessandfacilitation">Group Process and Facilitation</h2>

<p>The group is informally facilitated by a group member. To prepare for the group they passed out a few responsibilities to the group members. First he asked if there was anyone who was there after recently drinking. Second he asked if there were any outside visitors (me and my fellow studier). Third he arranged for a group member to read through the goals and policies of AA. Fourth, another group member read through a document that described what how a person can best be helped by the program. The group leader then told the group that they would be taking a moment of silence and praying the serenity prayer, if members wanted to participate. As cited by Online AA Recovery Resources (2007) serenity prayer is as follows;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Serenity Prayer</strong></p>
  
  <p>God, grant me the serenity <br />
  to accept the things I cannot change, <br />
  Courage to change the things I can, and <br />
  Wisdom to know the difference.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After these more formal procedures were followed by the group leader, he opened up the floor for any of the members to discuss the topics that were written down on the paper. The topics for the night were laziness and being a workaholic. When nobody seemed willing to open up the discussion, the group facilitator quickly jumped in and shared his experience with both topics. Then he opened the floor for everybody else to speak again. After a little hesitation two other members stepped up and talked. When the group members were more reluctant to share, the facilitator went down the list of names and asked each member if they wanted to share. Each member shared at varying lengths, all of them talked about both topics. After each of the members shared, he specifically asked me and my group mate if we wanted to share. We both declined. To close the meeting the facilitator invited anybody who wanted to pray the Lords Prayer to join in a circle and hold hands. Spirit Heart Sanctuary (2005) states the Lords prayer as follows;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our father, who art in Heaven, Hallowed be thy name; <br />
  Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done. <br />
  On earth, as it is in heaven. <br />
  Give us this day our daily bread; <br />
  And forgive us our debts, as we have forgiven our debtors; <br />
  And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. <br />
  For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the end of the prayer each member in unison quoted "keep coming back, it works if you work it and your worth it." The group then dissipated into small groups who stood around chatting and drinking coffee. One of the members stood around with me and my group member and asked us a few questions about our schooling and why we came. We answered honestly and then left the group.</p>

<h2 id="personalreactiontogroupmeeting">Personal Reaction to Group Meeting</h2>

<p>Going to the AA meeting was very powerful. From listening to all of the testimonies of the group members, every one of them said that the program had helped them. I really think that it is a powerful acknowledgement of how important relationships and accountability are in people’s lives. The fact a lay person could facilitate groups such as AA meetings and be effective was encouraging to me as a potential trained group leader. It took away some of the fears about actually leading a group. It seems as if there are many benefits to AA group meetings, but I also wondered if it is the most effective way to help these people. Helliker (2006) tells about AA financial reports for 2005. As a nonprofit they reported revenue of $13.2 million. Their acknowledged expenses were only $12.9 million. AA has no small budget, with a large financial gain. Smart and Mann (2000) quote that there were already 92,000 AA groups in 1990 and these numbers are going up. There are many groups that are similar in concept to AA. With this being such a common form of treatment, I wonder if there is a better way?</p>

<p>I was also very surprised to hear how often some of the members have group. One member, as I previously stated, mentioned at one point going to four or five groups. I guess it goes to show that people will do what ever it takes to change if they want change badly enough. In looking at the facilitation of the group, I do not think I would choose to lead a group as AA does. I think time can often be better spent purposely working towards a specific goal. My leadership style is defiantly not laissez fair.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="sampling">Sampling</h2>

<p>Sampling and population are two important and often confused subjects in research. They can be defined as;</p>

<p><strong>Population:</strong> Theoretically specified group of studied elements or the large group results are generalized to</p>

<p><strong>Sample:</strong> Study participants, usually a smaller group or a subset of the population</p>

<p><strong>Sampling:</strong> process of selective study participants</p>
  
       [caption id="" align="alignnone" width="689.0"]<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51dcde94e4b09506a9c98fbc/525af6cbe4b077ec7f4a4a44/52a3a891e4b0f6168e51b92d/1386457234785/research-methods-sampling-population.png" alt=" A graphic of a diagram showing sampling and population. "/>  A graphic of a diagram showing sampling and population. [/caption] 
  

<p>There are two types of sampling, probability and it's opposite. Within there these general types, there are many different examples and kinds. A few of them are listed below.</p>

<h2 id="probabilitysampling">Probability Sampling</h2>

<ul>
<li>Every member of the population has a known &amp; equal chance of being selected for the study</li>
<li><p>Random selection is a key element</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Simple Random Sampling:</strong> Each member of population is assigned a number, then random drawing of numbers is done.</p></li>
<li><strong>Systematic Random Sampling:</strong> Every kB element is selected (i.e. every 4th name is chosen)</li>
<li><p><strong>Stratified Random Sampling:</strong></p>

<ul><li>Group of participants are in layers / levels</li>
<li>Break into groups, then randomly select from the groups</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="nonprobabilitysampling">Non-Probability Sampling</h2>

<ul>
<li>Not random</li>
<li><p>Unequal chance of selection</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Snowball Sampling</strong></p>

<ul><li>Participants refer others to the study</li>
<li>Works well with hidden populations</li></ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Convenience or Available Participants</strong></p>

<ul><li>Just choosing participants because the people are available</li>
<li>Often if a survey in the middle of the pub</li></ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Quota</strong></p>

<ul><li>The non-random parallel to stratified sampling</li>
<li>Characteristic qualifies for study (i.e. demographic, age…etc)</li></ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Purposive Sampling</strong></p>

<ul><li>Criteria or diagnostic category qualifies for participation (not random)</li>
<li>For example, finding information on people who have been molested and their cases have been brought to court</li></ul></li>

<p>You can read a downloadable version of the article:  <a href="/s/crc-executive-summary-literature-review-methodology.pdf">Directions Program Evaluation Literature Review and Methodology</a></p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>The Crisis Residential Center's (CRC) Directions Program Evaluation for the 2006-2008 Financial Grant Years plans to look into the effectiveness of the aforementioned program. To do this, the existing literature regarding youth similar to those found at the CRC is examined. Previous research has studied at-risk youth and residential centers. This study seeks add upon the this data by looking specifically at a short term residential center, and it's programs from multiple perspectives. To perform the effectiveness study of the Directions Program both qualitative and quantitative methods are used.</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>According to the U.S. Conference of Mayors (2007), as cited by the National Coalition for the Homeless (2008), youth who are not living with their families make up 1% of the total urban homeless population. The U.S. Department of Justice's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention found there were about 1,682,900 youth who ran away or were forced out of their homes (Flores, 2002; Molino, 2007; Hammer, Finkelhor &amp; Sedlak, 2002; National Coalition for the Homeless, 2008). Approximately over 1.5 million of these youth have been in danger while they were away from home due to physical or substance abuse. Unfortunately, caretakers only reported less than a quarter of these youth to the police or to an agency which helps find missing children. These youth were comprised of 50% male and 50% female. Most (57%) were White, non-Hispanic (Hammer et. al., 2002).</p>

<h3 id="reasonsforrunawayandhomelessyouth">Reasons for Runaway and Homeless Youth</h3>

<p>Youth runaway and become homeless for several reasons. Many come from homes where they are not feeling supported or nurtured. These homes are often single-parent households or broken homes (Kidd, 2006; Miller, Donahue, Este &amp; Hofer, 2004). According to a study, which looked at more than 600 adolescents who were homeless or runaways, their families were often abusive or neglectful toward the youth. In addition, there could be parental substance abuse and issues with the law (Whitbeck &amp; Hoyt, 1999). For example, many of the youth reported one or more of their parents had a substance abuse issue, 56% with alcohol and 15% with marijuana (Whitbeck &amp; Hoyt, 1999). Youth who had a biological parent who abused alcohol or drugs were more likely to sell them (Whitbeck &amp; Hoyt, 1999).</p>

<p>Also, many homeless youth have issues with school such as attendance. The study by Miller et. al. (2004), which interviewed 19 youth, found most dropped out of school before they were able to graduate. Many felt "while life on the street was not easy, it was preferable to the life they had left" (Miller et. al., 2004, p. 740).</p>

<p>Additionally, homeless youth face barriers which keep them homeless. The street youth typically lack in education which may limit their ability to get a job or at least earn enough money to support themselves. The youth in the Miller et. al. (2004) study stated fear hindered their ability to attempt to combat homelessness partly due to negative previous experiences they had utilizing services.</p>

<h3 id="consequences">Consequences</h3>

<p>There are many consequences for youth living on the street. According to Whitbeck and Hoyt (1999), support networks are incredibly important for adolescents and influence their behavior. By running away, these adolescents severed the ties with any positive social networks. Thus, they formed relationships with individuals who may not be positive influences. While on the street there is an increased chance adolescents will be exposed to violence including being sexually assaulted from those individuals they interact with (Whitbeck &amp; Hoyt, 1999).</p>

<p>Adolescents who are homeless face developing depression, conduct disorder, and physical health issues (Robertson, 1989). In the study by Whitbeck and Hoyt (1999), approximately 18% of the youth stated they had a health concern which they wanted to see a doctor about. However, youth on the streets generally do not access health care. One reason for this is they typically do not see helping professionals as being effective at meeting their needs.</p>

<h3 id="practicesforworkingwithhomeless">Practices for Working with Homeless</h3>

<p>Programs which work with homeless and at-risk youth have a number of practices they can implement. These include things such as individual, group, and family therapy. They also often provide referrals to community services. The environment is a factor and often these programs employ a therapeutic milieu community.</p>

<p>Silvan, Matzner, and Silva (1999) consider the milieu community a major part of therapeutic programs. As a component of treatment, it can be used along with individual, group, and family therapy. This milieu community can also help solidify skills learned in treatment and provide a consistent structure. It provides support, encouragement, empathy, and nurtures those involved as well as offers a way to teach skills. This milieu community can also foster a peer identity. This affects the attitudes and values of the youth involved in the community.</p>

<p>Within the milieu therapeutic community, members of a therapy group are bonded together by a common interest (Toseland &amp; Rivas, 2005). Zimet and Farley (1985) state groups provide the client with interpersonal experiences to help foster social skills (as cited in Silvan, Matzner, &amp; Silva, 1999, p. 469). In residential treatment programs, groups are led by trained facilitators who teach youth and their families skills to foster independence, communication, and family reunification. They also provide opportunities for clients to help each other in learning the skills (Miley, O'Melia, &amp; DuBois, 2004). Group therapy functions well in the milieu environment as these skills and the group cohesion are reinforced throughout the day.</p>

<p>In addition to providing a conducive environment for group therapy, the milieu environment fosters therapeutic relationships with staff. Both staff and clients feel this positive relationship is a key component of successful treatment. Therefore, the development of this relationship is important in the treatment process (Nebbitt, House, Thompson, &amp; Pollio, 2007).</p>

<p>Apart from the milieu environment and the relationships and skill building it enhances, another key treatment is family therapy (Silvan, Matzner, &amp; Silva, 1999). Family issues have been identified as being a main precipitating problem which leads to youth running away (Safyer, Thompson, Macio, Zittel-Palamara, &amp; Forehand, 2004). Thus, it is interesting to note studies have found successful family reunification upon discharge has led to improvements on various aspects such as school, runaway behaviors, and family stability (Thompson, Pollio, &amp; Bitner, 2000; Teare, Furst, Peterson, &amp; Authier, 1992).</p>

<p>In addition to runaway behaviors, at-risk youth often face behavioral issues such as drug use. Research has found family interaction and reunification improved such behaviors (Schmidt, Liddle, and Dakof, 1996; Huey, Henggeler, Brondino, &amp; Pickrel, 2000). Sunseri (2004) adds children with high-functioning families have greater improvements in behavior after treatment.</p>

<p>Family involvement in treatment also reduces the risk of recidivism. A study by Lakin, Brambila, &amp; Sigda (2004) found family therapy attendance correlated with less recidivism and readmission at a children's residential center. Johnson, Farquhar and Sussman (1996) and Shane (1999) describe involvement in family therapy as a part of treatment, which leads to positive outcomes (as cited in Thompson, Kost, &amp; Pollio, 2003, p. 302). This includes a decrease of problem behaviors, a reduction in the likelihood and need for readmission, and an increase in family functioning (Lakin, Brambila, &amp; Sigda, 2004). Thus, it is agreed among many researchers family therapy is key to achieving positive outcomes.</p>

<p>Referrals to other services also lead to positive outcomes. Clients and families are referred to other agencies or services to foster continued improvements to the client's individualized treatment plan. These referrals may be to agencies which offer services such as family therapy, rehabilitation services, or mental health treatment. Nebbitt, et al. (2007) found participation in referrals after discharge facilitated the successful reunification of the family. This highlights the need for continued intervention.</p>

<p>While there have been studies focusing on family relationships and the needs of at-risk and runaway youth, few recent studies have focused on residential treatment programs which serve this population. Even fewer studies researched the effect of the programs from the clients' perspective. Thus, this study builds on previous research by adding a component, which looks into the perception of the clients.</p>

<h2 id="agencyinformation">Agency Information</h2>

<p>Youth Family Adult (YFA) Connections is a private independent 501(c) (3) nonprofit agency who serves the greater Spokane area with counseling and substance abuse treatment programs. YFA Connections, originally established as the Youth Help Organization in 1969, focused on working with Spokane's youth and their involvement in illegal and addictive drugs. Since then, the agency has come to offer a wide range of counseling and treatment services to a diverse group of clients. These clients need housing, family interventions, and substance abuse treatment. In 1997 the name was changed to the current YFA Connections to better describe the diverse clients served (YFA Connections, n.d., About us).</p>

<p>One program offered through YFA Connections is Spokane's Regional Crisis Residential Center (CRC). The CRC assists youth 13-17 years-old who come from a variety situations (YFA Connections, n.d.a, Youth and family services; Christensen, 2008). Youth who stay at the CRC receive individual, group, and family sessions tailored to their personal needs. While these needs are different for each client, there are some commonalities. For example, many clients are runaways and / or homeless or their family is in crisis. They often lack skills such as emotional regulation, basic living, and interpersonal skills. In addition, family relationships need strengthening. Furthermore, these youth and families are often not linked to community services and are in need of help in planning for a healthy future (YFA Connections, n.d.a, Youth and family services).</p>

<p>To meet these needs the CRC has three different programs: Directions, State CRC, and HOPE (Homeless Youth Prevention / Protection and Education). Each of these programs has different legislation governing them, programmatic focuses, and durations of stay. While these three programs have many similarities, they each have a different focus. Furthermore, the structure of each program effects how each of the other programs are implemented. The various interventions and requirements of each of these programs are made and the experience of the youth living at the CRC is similar regardless of the specific program they are involved with.</p>

<h3 id="statecrcprogram">State CRC Program</h3>

<p>The State CRC Program is funded and regulated by Washington State through the Revised Code of Washington [RCW] (Crisis residential centers [CRCs], 1995; CRCs, 1998; CRCs, 2000a; CRCs, 200b; CRCs, 1979). The RCW places specific expectations on agencies funded as Crisis Residential Centers. They are required to give documentation back to the Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS) regarding the clients. This includes the number, age, sex, referral source, precipitating event, services provided, ultimate dispositions, and length of stay (CRCs, 1979).</p>

<p>A number of services are required to be a part of the CRC. These include things such as multidisciplinary team meetings where professionals from various fields meet to assess the needs of the clients and to determine interventions. Furthermore, clients have the option to see mental health professionals when the need arises (CRCs, 2000a). The staff at the CRC are trained to effectively counsel the youth admitted to their program. They provide treatment, supervision, and structure (CRCs, 1998). Youth may stay for only five days (CRCs, 1995).</p>

<h3 id="statehopeprogram">State HOPE Program</h3>

<p>The HOPE Program is funded by Washington State through the HOPE act (Short title, 1999). Similar to the State CRC Program, the HOPE Program is given its rules and funding through the RCW (HOPE centers, 1999a, HOPE centers, 1999b; HOPE centers, 1999c; HOPE centers, 1999d; HOPE centers, 2008; Short title, 1999). Youth must either be a street youth or participating in increasingly risky behavior (HOPE centers, 2008). For example, risky behaviors may include drug abuse or reckless sexual activity.</p>

<p>Youth stay in the HOPE Program for 30 days. They often transfer to the HOPE Program from the State CRC Program when a suitable placement is not to be found in the allotted time. These youth often have failed foster care placements, have few resources given by DSHS, and often live dangerously. Clients are connected with education, counseling, and self-development programs to help them become more self-sufficient (Seattle post-intelligencer editorial board, 1999).</p>

<h3 id="federaldirectionsprogram">Federal Directions Program</h3>

<p>The Federal Basic Center Grant funds the Directions Program. The Basic Center Grants' stated purpose is strengthening community-based programs addressing the immediate needs of runaway and homeless youth and their families. These centers provide youth with emergency shelter, food, clothing, counseling, and referrals for health care. The grant funds three-year periods and allows the organization to reapply (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services [HHS], 2008). This grant's financial year operates from October 1 to September 30. The current grant runs from 2006 to 2009. The Directions Program has been receiving the Basic Center Grant since 1986 with only a few exceptions (T. Wright, personal communication, November 3, 2008).</p>

<p>The Directions program has specific service requirements to be able to receive the Basic Center Grant. The HHS described these requirements and the U.S. Code puts them into law. To serve their clients they are required to; A) provide temporary shelter, B) have an individualized intake process with the proper paperwork, C) engage in case disposition, D) employ individual, group and family counseling, E) offer recreational activities, F) link clients to services in the community, and G) make aftercare services available (HSS, 2007; Basic center grant program 2006).</p>

<h3 id="agencymissionrelatedtotheresearchproject">Agency Mission Related to the Research Project</h3>

<p>YFA's stated mission is to "provide prevention, intervention, education and treatment services to youth, families, and adults experiencing conflict or crisis" (YFA Connections, n.d., About us). Their vision statement is "to create an open and safe environment, devoted to enhancing community wellness through active partnerships with families, communities and agencies" (YFA Connections, n.d., About us). Although these statements are broader than just the Directions Program, there is a definite connection between the agency mission and the research project.</p>

<p>The research project explores how effective the Directions Program is at facilitating lasting change and meeting the needs of its clients during the current grant years. It also examines the clients' perspectives about the impact of the CRC. Finally, part of the effectiveness study looks at what outside resources clients have used after discharging. This helps the CRC know what can be improved to be better able to reach the diverse needs of their clients in the upcoming 2009 year.</p>

<p>This research seeks to promote change for the Directions Program and add to the knowledge of other similar programs in Washington State and around the country. The research and recommendations will help the CRC in their mission of providing services to their clients. Because the Regional CRCs and HOPE Centers run their programs based on the same legislation and expected practices, the research findings will be applicable overall. This is also true with Basic Centers around the country.</p>

<p>The Directions Program, State CRC, and HOPE programs all require accountability to the various government organizations and the YFA Connections board of directors. To keep up with these accountability requirements, the CRC does programmatic evaluations, however not to the scale of this research project. Reports regarding the various programs are sent to their oversight committees (i.e. federal or state). These reports give minimal data regarding some of the activities of the program, such as how many youth are served and the various referral sources given. However, they do not compile in-depth information that could be insightful to a program evaluation. They also do not include any reports on former clients' and their legal guardians' perspective regarding the program. This research project attempts to add the missing pieces of the previous effectiveness studies.</p>

<h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2>

<h3 id="objectivesofresearch">Objectives of Research</h3>

<p>This study (see <a href="https://jacob-campbell.squarespace.com/resources/directions-program-evaluation-appendix-a-timeline">appendix A</a> for attached timeline) seeks to determine the effectiveness of the CRC's Directions Program in facilitating lasting change and meeting the needs of its clients during the current financial grant years. The objective of this research project is to determine the impact the Directions Program has on its clients and their families. This will help to identify specific procedures and interventions needed to improved at mezzo and macro level. Furthermore, it is to give a voice to former clients and their families about their experience at the CRC.</p>

<p>An understanding of the client's history will be obtained through examining their files. Data regarding all former clients for the 2006-2008 financial grant years will be collected in regards to demographics, programmatic statistics, client history, and the initial Global Appraisal of Individual Needs – Short Screener (GAIN-SS) score. The legal guardians' perspective will be extrapolated through mail-in surveys. An in-depth interview and a mail-in survey will give an understanding of the effectiveness of the program though the client's perspective. Finally, a pretest posttest method of the GAIN-SS shows change over time in the participant's lives. The study will use both qualitative and quantitative approaches to reach this means.</p>

<h3 id="hypothesesandoperationaldefinitions">Hypotheses and Operational Definitions</h3>

<p>The research question guiding this project seeks to determine the effectiveness of the CRC's Directions Program in facilitating lasting change and meeting the needs of its clients during the financial grant years for 2006-2008. Four hypotheses are used to explore this research question.</p>

<p><strong>Hypothesis 1</strong>: Positive Impact in Former Clients Life</p>

<p>The Directions Program had a positive impact on the clients who completed and participated in the program. Completion and participation in the Directions Program will be defined as the client being discharged with their advocate's approval. A lower GAIN-SS score and the clients' self-report in the surveys and in-depth interviews demonstrate the positive impact.</p>

<p><strong>Hypothesis II</strong>: Positive Impact of Family Relationships</p>

<p>Completing the Directions Program has a positive impact on client's relationship with their families. Completing the Directions Program is defined the same as in hypothesis I. The improved relationships with the family will be defined by the self-report of the legal guardians and clients in the surveys and in-depth interviews.</p>

<p><strong>Hypothesis III</strong>: Referrals and Family Relationships</p>

<p>The use of one or more referrals is positively correlated to lasting improvement in the client's family relationships. The participants' self-report on the surveys will define the use of referrals. The participants report on their lasting improvement via the surveys and in-depth interviews.</p>

<p><strong>Hypothesis IV</strong>: Referrals and Client's Lives</p>

<p>The use of one or more referrals is positively correlated to lasting improvement in the client's lives. The participants self-report on the surveys will define the use of referrals. The participants report on their lasting improvement via the surveys, in-depth interviews, and a lower GAIN-SS score.</p>

<h3 id="researchparticipants">Research Participants</h3>

<p>The participants include former clients of the CRC's Directions Program as well as their legal guardians. There will be approximately 260 participants, 127 of which are former clients' with ages ranging from 13-19 and 127 adults, which are their primary caregivers. The participants will be all the former clients who went through the CRC's Directions Program between October 1, 2006 and September 30, 2008.</p>

<h3 id="datacollectionmethodsandprocedures">Data Collection Methods and Procedures</h3>

<p>There will be five methods of data collection utilized in this research project. First, client files will be studied and pertinent information extrapolated so quantitative background data can be gathered on the former clients. This background data will include demographics, programmatic statistics, client histories, and pretest GAIN-SS scores. Second, a survey will be sent (see <a href="/s/crc-effectiveness-guardian-survey_0.pdf">appendix B</a>) to the legal guardians asking both closed-ended Likert scale questions as well as some open-ended questions. Questions cover topics such as satisfaction with the Directions Program, referrals used and their impressions, and affect on family relationships. Third, a mail-in survey with former Directions Program clients (see <a href="/s/crc-effectiveness-client-survey_0.pdf">appendix C</a>) asks both closed-ended Likert scale questions as well as some open-ended questions. The questions cover topics such as, perceptions of the programs interventions, family relationships, and relationships with staff. Furthermore, the GAIN-SS questions have been adapted from the form distributed by Chestnut Health Systems to be given in the mail-in survey. In addition, the researchers will conduct a more in-depth, qualitative, informal interview (see <a href="/s/crc-effectiveness-in-depth-interview-questions_0.pdf">appendix D</a>).</p>

<h2 id="measurement">Measurement</h2>

<p>One of the assessment tools the CRC utilizes is the GAIN-SS. The GAIN-SS is a shortened version of the Global Appraisal of Individual Needs (GAIN). There are three main uses for the GAIN-SS; 1) to quickly identify clients who would benefit from further work with a Licensed Mental Health Practitioner, 2) to be usable by staff with minimal training, and 3) as a periodic measure of change over time (Chestnut Health Systems, n.d.; Dennis, Chan, &amp; Funk, 2006).</p>

<p>The GAIN-SS identifies issues regarding four areas: internalizing disorders, externalizing disorders, substance disorders, and crime and violence. Dennis, Chan and Funk (2006) found the GAINS-SS appeared to be capable of quickly identifying people who might have a problem in the four areas of interest.</p>

<p>The GAIN-SS will be used to show change over time regarding former clients. All clients in the Directions Program are given the GAIN-SS upon entrance into the CRC. The questions from the GAIN-SS have been adapted and added to the former client mail in survey. This will allow the researchers to compare the levels of change regarding the four areas the GAIN-SS looks at.</p>

<p>For my Master's degree in Social Work at Eastern Washington University, I was required to complete a research project. Jennifer Boisen, Shireen Wheeler, and I all participated in the formulation, implementation the this research project. The Internal Review Board (IRB) of Eastern Washington University approved the research project. Dr. Kim Stansbury provided supervision on the behalf of the university. Teresa Wright provided supervision on the behalf of YFA Connections Crisis Residential Center.</p>

<p>Like any research project, a lot of work and planning went into its implementation. The research project took about six months to be completed. These documents are being provided as an example of conducting research.</p>

<p>With most studies, the researcher must complete an official process prior to the implementation of the study. In our case, it was no different. We went through a formal review by the IRB of Eastern Washington University to obtain permission to conduct our research. This process took eight different revisions to be passed.</p>

<p>Before the actual research can be conducted during a study, a thorough literature review ought to be conducted. This requires that the researchers need to look at the research that has been done previously. Within our literature review, we found our research to be additive and unique to social work research. The following are the resources regarding both the literature review and methodology of the study completed:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="/s/crc-effectiveness-in-depth-interview-questions_0.pdf">Appendix D, In-depth Interview Questions</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The expected timeline was as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>01/07/09 - Mail surveys</li>
<li>01/14/09 - Begin phone calls an individual in-depth interviews with former clients</li>
<li>01/21/09 - Mail follow-up letters</li>
<li>02/13/09 - Expected date for surveys</li>
<li>03/13/09 - Final project completed</li>
<li>04/30/12 - All identifying data will be destroyed</li>
</ul>

<p>The research project both looked into the former client's files (extracting archival data) and data from surveys sent to both the former clients and their parents. The original plan was also to complete in-depth interviews with a couple of the former clients. Due to the lack of the responses, no in-depth interviews were completed. The final document that we completed was an executive summary.</p>

      <title>Research Description &amp; Research Types</title>
      <link>/resources/research-description-research-types</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="purposeofresearch">Purpose of research</h2>

<p>The first thing to look at in regards to activity that is done is they why. If there is no reason to do something, then why would you do it?</p>

<p>There are three main reasons that social workers need to understand research;</p>

<ul>
<li>Read &amp; understand other studies</li>
<li>Evaluate your practice</li>
<li>Improve client's well being</li>
<li>Stabilize your practice methods</li>
<li>Decline fallibility of bad practice methods</li>
<li>Conduct your own research study's</li>
</ul>

<p>All research can be broken up into three purposes. These are exploration, description, and explanation. Each of these purposes become more complex as listed. <strong>Exploration</strong> is what all qualitative studies are (don't worry, we'll go over qualitative vs. quantitative later). They are normally to gain familiarity with a topic, breaking new ground with subjects that have not been studied. They are never trying to generalize, and often generate more research questions. <strong>Descriptive</strong> studies are quantitative and what most social science studies are. They use a representative sample size so that it can be generalized to the entire population. There is an emphasis on accuracy &amp; precision, and not on cause &amp; effect. <strong>Explanation</strong> studies seek to solve the cause and effects of various activities. They seek to understand the why. To do this they test hypotheses using the scientific method.</p>

<p>Many social workers are in the profession to work directly with people and might not see the need for research. Really there are a number of similarities between research and practice. First they both are for the purpose of problem solving, e.g. reducing or solving problems. They focus on vulnerable population and utilize strengths perspective.</p>

<p>Although they both follow these similarities, there are differences in how individuals purse truth in working with their clients. Every social worker's should have the goal to rely on multiple realities. This means being guided both by logic and experience, and not only being guided by what others tell you or your own limited experience. <strong>Agreement reality</strong> is finding truth based on what others say is correct. This type of truth is really an <em>Ad Hominin</em>. For example, if the worker follows a particular practice simply because it is what many of the agency staff believes is true. <strong>Experiential reality</strong> is finding truth based simply on methods learned due to direct experience. The fact that something is true in certain cases, does not mean that it is universal and can be contradicted in other circumstances. The <strong>Scientific approach</strong> is the method for finding truth that leads to truth not limited to just one of these realities. It is the basis for evidence based practice.</p>

<h2 id="typesofresearch">Types of Research</h2>

<p>Research can generally be broken up into two different parts, qualitative and quantitative. Many think that this simply has to do with numbers of participants in the study, but this is not true. In fact hard numbers really cannot be given to describe whether a study is qualitative or quantitative. In general, qualitative can be thought of a study of depth and quantitative as a study of breadth.</p>

<div style="background-color:#CCC; border:#000 thin solid; float:left; padding: 10px; margin: 0px 5px 0px 0px;">
    <p style="margin: 0;"><strong>Process</strong></p><ul style="margin: 0; list-style-type:none; "><li> Treatment variables</li><li>Reason for improvement</li><li>Contextual issues</li></ul><p style="margin: 0;"><strong>Outcome:</strong> Improvement goals</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Qualitative</strong> studies use a family of methods (e.g. ethnographic interviews, narrative analysis… etc.) to do exploratory research. It is trying to capture the lived experience of someone, often dealing with sensitive areas of the participant's lives. It is studying process variables and outcomes in practice evaluations.</p>

<p><strong>Quantitative</strong> studies have the same purposes of both the descriptive and explanative studies. To better understand the differences in qualitative vs. quantitative studies the following is a table describe the similarities and differences.</p>

<p>A genogram is more commonly known as a family tree. Genograms tend to be more specific and detailed in information then common family trees. They focus on looking at specific traits, characteristics, and behaviors that go through generations of a specific family. For example, they often trace cancer, longevity of marital relationships, or alcoholism in the family's history.</p>

<p>This history is that is described in a genogram is different for each individual or family. Genograms contribute to the concept of dealing with the person in the context of their environment. Even looking introspectively at my own life I can see some of the ways my family history has influenced me. Along with describing family relationships, I have also looked at a few other aspects of my family history (see "Figure #1); first is family members who are involved in social services (generally social work type jobs), then cancer, and finally alcoholism.</p>

</div><p>Many traditional cultures used the concept of apprenticeship, having the child participate in the family trade. This even happens in modern times, most of the time not by design. My family would be an example of that family career happening not by design. My mom has had many social worker professions (she has a BA of Applied Behavioral Psychology). Growing up, she was a clinical counselor, branch director of a social service agency, case manager, and started a couple of community programs. My aunts on that side have all either been employed in social services or done that in their private life. Roxanne Brown is currently working as a clinical counselor and case manager for County Corrections in Tacoma Washington. My aunt Barbra Dirks works for a non-social service business, but has done numerous advocacy programs involving gay rights, and is a member of the national board of NOW (National Organization for Women). This is true of all my aunts on my mom's side. It would be interesting to take a deep look at what family circumstances might have contributed to this phenomenon.</p>

<p>In America and around the world people are living longer lives. With increased life span, cancer has become a relevant and fearful factor in people's lives. Cancer has a highly hereditary correlation that makes mapping it out in a genogram a valuable characteristic to chart when working with clients. My own family has a rich history of cancer. This fact can be even more drastically seen when the breadth of view is increased to my grandparent's brothers and sisters and their family lines.</p>

<p>Many problematic behaviors tend to be passed on through generations, and some are even corollary thought to be hereditary. Alcoholism and other addictive behaviors are often seen running through family histories. My family history shows it to be a relevant topic. Due to family conflicts on my dads side of the family, I have limited information. After my dad's death, his father was very unwilling to communicate with me and my mom. In the seventh grade I had an assignment to create a family tree. When I called him to hear my family history, he told me to "never fucking call him again." My mom wrote him a letter recently seeing if he was ready to re-open the lines of communication, but there is no real way of know what will come of this. From talking to my mom, it sounds like there might even be more alcoholism on that side of the family then is apparent on the chart.</p>

<p>Genograms help in arriving at a clearer picture of PIE (Person In the Environment) in regards to self-evaluation or with a client. In contrast to a genograms picture to an eco-map, it could be compared to the difference between looking at Michelangelo's "Creation of Adam," verses the entire ceiling at Sistine Chapel. Genograms look at one aspect of the different systems that are described in an eco-map. I created an eco-map for both my own life1 (see Figure #2), and for the family in the movie <em>In America</em> (2002) (see Figure #3). In both of these examples, I chose to graphically represent the systems involved in my / their lives as pieces to a puzzle. This is especially appropriate as a metaphor showing that each of these systems make up a piece of the puzzle of each of our lives. The interaction between these systems is dynamic. In these dynamic interactions some of the systems act as inputs, outputs or even as a two-way interaction. Some of these interactions require more energy, often targeted as stressful relationships.</p>

</div><p>The movie, <em>In America</em>, gives a powerful portrayal of the effect of difficult circumstances that often take place in our lives. Using an eco-map can clearly shows some of the relationships of different systems in the client's life. In the movies example, we the client would likely be either Sarah or Johnny. Social workers work with their clients in a variety of roles. Using an eco-map can help the client see areas that they have power over, and areas of strength. Along with looking at areas' of strength, we can more clearly see some of the areas with circumstances that need intervention. When we take the time to really work out a complete eco-map and utilize the tools we have, it can be a very productive experience for our clients.</p>

<p>Using the movie as a case study, and choosing Sarah as our prospective client, we see at least four roles a social worker can play. Firstly, they act as a facilitator. When a social worker starts to work with a client, they are not familiar with all of the client's circumstances. Acting as a facilitator allows both the social worker and the client to process the various systems at play. Secondly, the social worker can act as a counselor. Counseling in regards to an eco-map might include talking though different issues regarding the systems that the client is involved in. This working though, includes using the Generalist Intervention Model (GIM), and helping the client find solutions to some of their issues. In Sarah's case, an issue that has effect on the entire family is their poverty. This seems to have a particularly negative (weighty) effect on Johnny. As a counselor, the social worker might look to decrease the families spending, increase their income. Thirdly, a social worker can act as a broker. Being a broker focus's on linking the client with resources. Utilizing the previous example of poverty, the social worker could connect Sarah's with a financial expert, if they did not have the necessary skills to most effectively help her. Fourthly, the social worker can act as a mediator. The role of a mediator is one of being a go in-between for the client and other systems (micro, mezzo and macro). In Sarah's case, the social worker could talk with the hospital (mezzo level) and try to work out some kind of reduced payment and a payment plan.</p>

<p>Maximizing these and other roles that a social worker fulfills should be done using the strengths perspective. The beauty of the strengths perspective is that every individual or family has strengths that can be focused on, no matter what the situation looks like. In his article Strengths Model Diagnosis, Morley Gilicken describes 40 different strengths that a social worker can look at. This is not, a exhaustive list of strengths, and leaves the social worker without the ability deny any applicable strength to an individual or family. Sarah's family has a number of different strengths;</p>

<li><strong>Family strength</strong>. In all of the family's difficulties they always draw closer to each other. This ability is what seems to pull them though many of their various circumstances.</li>
<li><strong>Creativity</strong>. They showed creativity in turning a poverty stricken, run-down, low class, junky filled apartment into a warm and happy place for their family. Creativity was also shown in the Halloween costumes for Christy and Ariel.</li>
<li><strong>Social responsibility</strong>. Johnny gives to a poorer tenant (also a drug addict), even when he and his family have a limited amount themselves. They also reach out to people in their apartment, such as Mateo.</li>
<li><strong>Financial intelligence</strong>. Sarah and Johnny make ends meet on a very constrictive budget (where a small amount of change is a important).</li>
<li><strong>Fun</strong>. Johnny plays "Fee, Fie, Foe, Fum..." with his daughters, and there are always a lot of smiles around their house.</li>
</ol>

<p>Sarah's family displays many more strengths then those listed here, but this already shows an encouraging picture of a family with many out-side pressures.</p>

<p>Individual's culture is often noted as a strength. In regards to Sarah's family, their culture could both be a strength or a deficit. Sarah's family draws a lot on the Irish culture, and it is very important to them. Much like Sarah's family, many people find their culture important. Social workers should attempt to always be culturally sensitive. This could include talking about disbelief in magical beings, because some Irish people believe in these sorts of things.</p>

<p>As mentioned the Irish culture can be a strength, and also somewhat of a weakness. It is vital to look at strengths of clients, but we also must be realists and see the deficits. Social workers encourage the clients to increase their strengths and to decrease their deficits. The point at which the social worker helps the client past one of their deficits, is the point of intervention. A social worker might intervene with Sarah's life in a number of different areas. Firstly the social worker could act as an educator and teach them some new skills in regards to managing their finances. Secondly the social worker could act as a broker and connect them to different services, such as TANIF or food stamps. Thirdly the social worker could act as a counselor and explore the death of Frankie or Mateo. Fourthly we could act as a mediator and work on the payment issue with the hospital, trying to advocate for financial assistance. Fifthly we could act as an advocate and work with the city on Sarah's family's housing situation. Self-determination is a major concept of in social work. The work that is done with the client is completely based on the client's willingness to change. If they do not desire change, then they will not change.</p>

<p>In the case that Sarah and her family desires to change, a social worker could work with them and bring about change. Using the tool of an eco-map, could be very helpful to the client. It allows them to clearly see their situation, to have clear goals to work towards, to see the strengths that their family has, and the areas that they need to work.</p>

<hr />

<p>1.) In working on this assignment I found it helpful to look at my own life systems before attempting to describe Sarah's families. I am including it with the assignment because it took time and effort, but it will not be discussed further because it is not a formal section of the assignment.</p>]]></content:encoded>
      <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Genograms and eco-maps are graphical representations to help process life circumstances. They are useful for describing relationships, characteristics, and seeing interactions form an aerial point of view. They are helpful for those in the helping traditions in working with clients. They can also be helpful when looking into personal history. Genograms help in arriving at a clearer picture of PIE (Person In the Environment) in regards to self-evaluation or with a client. The film In America (2002) serves as an example for how eco-maps can be put together.</p>]]></excerpt:encoded>

      <title>Solution-focused Brief Therapy Presentation</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390624997302_10494">hen I was working on my Master's in Social Work Degree in 2009 my employer, YFA Connections: Crisis Residential Center asked me to put together a training for their staff. At the time I had been taking a class regarding Solution-focused Brief Therapy. I later re-used (with the present changes) this presentation for the case manager at Tri-Cities Community Health Behavioral Health Services Department in 2011. Steve de Shazer, Insoo Kim Berg, and their colleagues developed Solution-Focused Brief Therapy starting in the late 1970’s. The intent of SFBT is to change the focus of therapy from symptoms and problems and to focus on actually finding the solutions. In my presentation (which doesn't upload well to this site, I use a video I downloaded from YouTube called <a href="http://youtu.be/J6BJxwJ0iCM" data-cke-saved-href="http://youtu.be/J6BJxwJ0iCM" target="_blank">Solution Focused Hunter</a>.</p>

<p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390624997302_12453">I created a Powerpoint Presentation, some hand out forms, and some interactive activities. I also completely designed the PowerPoint design layout. You can download <a href="/s/solution-focused-brief-therapy-presentation.pptx" data-cke-saved-href="/s/solution-focused-brief-therapy-presentation.pptx">the PowerPoint file</a>.</p><iframe src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/15646938?rel=0" width="427" height="356" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" style="border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px 1px 0; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;" allowfullscreen> </iframe> <div style="margin-bottom:5px"> <strong> <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/campjacob/solutionfocused-brief-therapy-powerpoint-presentation" title="Solution-focused Brief Therapy PowerPoint Presentation" target="_blank">Solution-focused Brief Therapy PowerPoint Presentation</a> </strong> from <strong><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/campjacob" target="_blank">Jacob Campbell</a></strong> </div><p>You can also find a copy of the <a target="_blank" href="/resources/solution-focused-brief-therapy-presentation-handout">Presentation Handout</a> I created for this presentation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Strengths Perspective and Mental Health</title>
      <link>/resources/strengths-perspective-and-mental-health</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our culture and society tend to focus on deficit based models of change. One place where this is evidenced most clearly is in the medical model. &nbsp;Workers involved in the medical profession focus almost completely on a problem focused framework. &nbsp;People generally only go to the doctors when they are sick (i.e. have specific symptoms). When they are seen by the doctor either through tests, examination, or self-report, they are given a diagnosis. If you go to an urgent care and tell them that you have these symptoms;</p><ul><li>A 100°F or higher fever or feeling feverish (not everyone with the flu has a fever)</li><li>A cough and/or sore throat</li><li>A runny or stuffy nose</li><li>Headaches and/or body aches</li><li>Chills</li><li>Fatigue</li><li>Nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea (most common in children)</li></ul><p>They will probably say that you have the flu and will prescribe medication or other treatment remedies to mitigate these symptoms. The same is frequently true in mental health. We look at the needs of the client from a negative symptom focus (i.e. depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure, weight loss / gain, insomnia / hypersomnia, psychomotor agitation / retardation, fatigue / energy loss, feelings of worthlessness / guilt, difficulty concentrating, recurrent thoughts of death… etc. then that could be described as a major depressive episode). Similar to the medical model, we implement techniques and therapeutic models to treat those symptoms.</p><p>One of the foundational components of social work is the strengths perspective (also called strengths based, strengths focused… etc.). When we comprehensively implement throughout our work, it is a different and new way of working with a client.</p><h2>What is Strengths Perspective?</h2><p>I recently went through my notes from social work, and I found strengths perspective listed a number of places, but I couldn't find any notes specifically focused only solely defining and discussing strengths perspective as a whole. I guess this is a part of why it's a perspective and not a treatment theory.</p><p>The strengths perspective is made up of discovering the inherent strengths of a client, not only the attempting to mitigate the symptoms the client has. When we do this, we decide to build on the skills, abilities, and resources of our clients and try to improve and adapt these to improve the lives of our clients.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="studydesign">Study Design</h2>

<p>Looking at a studies design helps to determine internal validity and causality of said study. It explains simply what you did and to whom you did it.The design of the study looks at the number of groups and measurements, the independent and dependent variables, and whether the sample was randomly assigned.</p>

<p>The researcher can enhance internal validity by having a comparison group and a control group. Furthermore, randomly selecting and assigning participants can increase internal validity and reduce selection bias.</p>

<h2 id="threetypesofdesign">Three Types of Design</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Pre-experimental</p>

<ul><li>Pilot study</li>
<li>Usually one group (makes this type vulnerable to threats to internal validity)</li>

<li><p>Quasi-experimental</p>

      <title>Paradigm's and Reasoning Types in Research</title>
      <link>/resources/paradigms-reasoning-types-research</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="paradigmsinresearch">Paradigm's in Research</h2>

<p>Research is a pursuit of the truth, attempting to find the best methods to reaching clients. A paradigm is a world view (a view point, the nature of reality). There are three different paradigms for social work research</p>

<p><strong>Positivism</strong>: This deals the the concept of there being an objective reality, i.e. there is a truth. This supports the pursuit of scientific inquiry. It focuses on the generalizeability, and objectivity of the research.</p>

<p><strong>Interpretivism</strong>: This purports individual perceptions as reality. Research focuses on finding the truth in the meaning of the experience (i.e. "How did the person feel" or interpretations of events). It is subjective</p>

<p><strong>Critical Social Science</strong>: Looks at the truth in the context and using person in the environment (PIE). It investigates existence within context. It works for the empowerment of oppressed groups, and utilizes both positivism and interpretivism.</p>

<div style="background-color:rgb(85,66,54); border:#000 thin solid; margin: 0px 5px 0px 0px; padding: 10px; float:left; color:rgb(211,206,61);">
<p><b>Empirically Discovered</b>:<br />
Scientifically discovered in a study</p>
</div>

<p>To compile research, other than paradigms there are also theories that must be examined. A theory is an organized body of concepts that attempts to explain an aspect of reality and has been or could be verified empirically. The following are the components of a theory;</p>

<ul>
<li>Set of interrelated statements</li>
<li>Hypothesis: prediction / educated guess</li>
<li>Concepts (variables) - pieces &amp; components</li>
<li>Observations - used to measure / assess a theory</li>
</ul>

"/>  A graphic displaying an deductive pyramid with a narrower base demonstrating that deductive reasoning starts from&nbsp;one or more general premises are used to reach a logical certain conclusion. [/caption] 
  

<p>There are both inductive and deductive reasoning types. In theories these are the chicken and the egg parable. Inductive, being the chicken before the egg, begins with observed data. The researching studies a subject and creates a theory to match the data. It could be shown as a pyramid with the peak at the top.</p>

<p>The egg to chicken version of theories is deductive reasoning. With deductive reasoning, the researcher begins with a theory first. They then follow the scientific model of hypothesis, test, hypothesis, test hypothesis… etc. It could be graphically described as a upside down pyramid, with the peak at the bottom.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Determining a Studies Internal Validity</title>
      <link>/resources/determining-studies-internal-validity</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Looking at a studies design helps to determine internal validity and causality in regards to the results of the study. It explains simply what you did to whom. The design of the study looks at the number of groups and measures, the independent and dependent variables, and whether the sample was randomly assigned.</p>

<p>The researcher can enhance internal validity by having a comparison group and a control group. Furthermore, randomly selecting and assigning participants can increase internal validity and reduce selection bias.</p>

<h2 id="waystoenhanceinternalvalidity">Ways to Enhance Internal Validity</h2>

<ol>
<li>Comparison group or control group</li>
<li>Randomly select &amp; randomly assign participants (helps with selection bias)</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="threetypesofdesign">Three Types of Design</h2>

<ul>
<li>Pre-experimental</li>
<li>Pilot study</li>
<li>Usually one group, vulnerable to threats to internal validity</li>
<li>Exploratory</li>
<li>Quasi-experimental</li>
<li>Does not involve random assignment</li>
<li>Usually two groups</li>
<li>Descriptive</li>
<li>Experimental</li>
<li>Cause and effect</li>
<li>Two groups, random assignments,… etc</li>
<li>Explanatory</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="internalvalidity">Internal Validity</h2>

<p><strong>Internal Validity:</strong> Confidence that change in the dependent variable is caused by the independent variable and not something else.</p>

<p><strong>Rival hypotheses:</strong> Another factor causing and or explaining the change in the dependent variable.</p>

<h2 id="threatstointernalvalidity">Threats to internal Validity</h2>

<p><strong>History:</strong> Outside even that coincides with the study &amp; might be the real cause of your findings</p>

<p><strong>Attrition or experimental mortality:</strong> In a longitudinal study, participants drop out</p>

<p><strong>Maturation or passage of time:</strong> Sometimes clients get better or worse as time passes without intervention</p>

<p><strong>Testing:</strong> Conditions of test that influence results (often pretests influences posttest results)</p>

<p><strong>Instrumentation:</strong> There is a problem in the measure (either a bad measure or it's administration was changed midway)</p>

<p><strong>Selection bias:</strong> Individuals choose to participate (groups are unequal || method of selecting participant's impacts results</p>

<p><strong>Statistical regression:</strong> Extremely low scores at the pretest will likely improve slightly at the posttest (AKA regression towards the mean)</p>

<p><strong>Ambiguity of causal influence:</strong> Can't tell which is the Independent Variable (IV) and the Dependent Variable (DV) ["The chicken and the egg affect"]</p>

<p><strong>Diffusion:</strong> Comparison and treatment group are getting very similar interventions</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2 id="callings">Callings</h2>

<p>I believe that deep down inside of each and every one of us, is a passion for something. One thing that have I have always enjoyed is listening to people talk about whatever they are passionate about. I love it when I get to see someone's eyes light up as they describe what they love to do. I think these things that we are so passionate about are our callings. Finding way's to do things we are passionate about is vital to a fufilled and satisfied life. Like King Soloman described in Ecclesiastes, there is a time for everything. My life has been full of different seasons. This website is to hopefully give you a bit of a picture of what some of those seasons have been. It's also meant to teach you a little bit of some of the stuff I've learned along the way.</p>

<h2 id="activities">Activities</h2>

<p>I've been told that, for my age, I have a lot more experiences then many people. I've been educated, having earned my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Social_Work">Masters of Social Work</a> from <a href="http://www.ewu.edu/">Eastern Washington University</a>. I have a strong passion for working with at-risk youth. I was a student and an intern at a program that was called the Master's Commission at <a href="http://www.victoryfaith.org/">Victory Faith Fellowship</a> in Spokane. Then I spent two years I spent two years working at a <a href="http://jyranch.org/">boy's ranch</a> and about six month working at Spokane Juvenile Detention. I worked for two years at the <a href="http://www.yfaconnections.org/">Crisis Residential Center</a> in Spokane. I'm curretly working for <a href="http://www.mytcch.org/">Tri-Cities Community Health</a>'s Behavioral Health Services in Pasco as a Mental Health Case Manager and Therapist. For more information regarding my work / education history check out my <a href="http://jacobrcampbell.com/professional-connections">professional connections section</a>. While, I believe formal education and work experience are important, I also have personal experience. I can really relate with at-risk youth because <a href="http://jacobrcampbell.com/testimony">I was one</a>. I grew up without a normal dad, visiting mine <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Campbell">in prison</a>.</p>

<p>Another thing that I am passionate about is traveling. I have been exteremly lucky in my life to travel a lot. I have tried to keep people updated about my life, via my website and social media. You can read my blog posts about <a href="http://jacobrcampbell.com/blog/european-excursion-2008">traveling through Europe in 2008</a>. In 2009 and 2010 I traveled through South America and ended up spending about a year living in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cusco">Cusco Peru</a>. You can read about my <a href="http://jacobrcampbell.com/blog/jaunt-down-south-2010">Juant Down South</a> or see why <a href="http://jacobrcampbell.com/blog/2009/07/let-world-change-you-and-you-can-change-world">I decided to travel down there</a>. While I don't always keep <a href="http://jacobrcampbell.com/blog">my blog</a> the most up to date, there are lots of different stories that I have written here.</p>]]></content:encoded>
